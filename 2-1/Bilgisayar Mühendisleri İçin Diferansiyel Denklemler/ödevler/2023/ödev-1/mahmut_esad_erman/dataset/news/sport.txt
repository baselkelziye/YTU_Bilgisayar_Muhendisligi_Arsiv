Australia look set to field two specialist spinners at the Sydney Cricket Ground  SCG  for the first time in a decade when they host West Indies in a dead rubber New Years test starting this weekend An inexperienced and demoralised West Indies touring party succumbed by an innings and     runs in Hobart and     runs in Melbourne to hand their hosts an unassailable     lead in the three match series That position  and the likelihood of a turning wicket at the SCG  have encouraged Australia to test out the twin spin option of Nathan Lyon and Stephen OKeefe ahead of their tour of Sri Lanka later this year That the hosts can afford to put out an experimental side in one of the more venerable fixtures in the Australian sporting calendar is not to say there will be nothing at stake when the match gets underway on Sunday       GMT  For West Indies there is pride and a chance to show more of the fighting spirit that stalled Australias victory match in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne last weekend A     sweep  meanwhile  would send Australia above India to second in the test rankings and they would return to the summit if England can maintain a winning start and beat South Africa in their ongoing four match series Off spinner Lyon is one of the first names on the Australian team sheet these days and he looks like being joined by left arm finger spinner OKeefe in the Australian line up That was made all the more likely when seamer Peter Siddle failed to train on Friday because of an ankle injury  leaving his place in the team in jeopardy OKeefes inclusion for his second test    his first on home soil    would make it the first time Australia have played twin spinners at the SCG since Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill took on South Africa at the ground in      Josh Hazlewood is likely to back up for a sixth straight test alongside James Pattinson in the pace attack with all rounder Mitchell Marsh offering support with his quickening medium pace deliveries after taking      in Melbourne While Darren Bravo  Denesh Ramdin and skipper Jason Holder showed some resistance with the bat in Melbourne  the paucity of the West Indies bowling is starkly illustrated by the fact that they have taken just    wickets over the first two tests Given how little pressure their pace attack have managed to exert on Australia so far in the series  West Indies might consider their own twin spin attack by bringing in leg spinner Devendra Bishoo alongside left arm orthodox Jomel Warrican 
After picking up pretty much every individual honour on offer in a spectacular       Australia captain Steve Smith has a more collective goal in his sights this year    restoring his country to the top of the test rankings Smith finished his annus mirabilis as the worlds top ranked test batsman and won the ICC Cricketer and Test Cricketer of the Year awards as well as the Allan Border Medal as Australias best player The    year old scored a remarkable       runs across all three formats  rattling up       in tests alone at an average of       with six centuries He was Australias highest run scorer as they secured a fifth    over World Cup triumph and he led the test side to series victories over India  New Zealand and West Indies Even in the Ashes defeat to England  the one major blot on Australias copy book for the year  he scored his maiden double century to claim the Man of the Match award at Lords Even before he was captain  though  Smith was always clear that team success came first With Australia already     up in the three match series  this weeks third test against West Indies might be a dead rubber but victory would send them above India into second place in the test rankings behind South Africa  Its a huge motivation  thats what we want to be  number one in all formats and were working extremely hard to get there   Smith told reporters on the eve of the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground  SCG  on Saturday  It would be nice to win this week and wrap this series up      Its been a good summer for us so far  so wed like to finish on a high  Defeat for South Africa in their ongoing series against England would then send Australia back to the summit but even if the English fail to build on their winning start  Februarys two test tour of New Zealand offers Smiths side another chance Australia beat the Black Caps     on home soil in November but the series was closer than the scoreline would suggest and Smiths side  like many of the top test teams  have struggled to win series overseas in recent years  Playing away from home is a challenge for all teams around the world at the moment  I think thats one of the big things were going to be judged on   Smith added  Its going to be a big challenge in New Zealand  but Im confident if we can continue playing the way we are  hopefully we can have a lot of success over there  Smiths own form hit a minor blip when he was dismissed for    in Australias only innings in the first test against West Indies but the runs were flowing again in Melbourne last week after knocks of     and    without being dismissed  I felt pretty good last week  I guess it was good just to spend a little bit of time in the middle again   Smith said  All of my movement and my swing and everything was back in synch I went back and looked at some footage before the Melbourne test and felt my bat face was a little bit closed  Last week I got my bat face back where I wanted it to be and everything felt really good  so hopefully I can score a few more this week 
 New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum on Sunday said tainted bowler Mohammad Amir should be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to play for Pakistan in limited overs matches in New Zealand this month Amir has been named in the Pakistan squad which will play three Twenty   and as many one day games against New Zealand over the next three weeks but his participation depends on New Zealand immigration officials allowing him a visa The fast bowler was only    when he handed a five year ban from cricket in      for his involvement in spot fixing He also served three months of a six month prison term His ban  imposed by the International Cricket Council  ICC   has now ended and McCullum said today he should be allowed to resume his career He was a very young man at the time and he s gone through a sound rehabilitation program  McCullum said If he gets out on the field against us  then you play against the man you re playing against  not a man who may have made some mistakes as a youngster  added the explosive batsman New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White also supported Amir s inclusion in the Pakistan squad but stressed that was a personal view and not that of his organisation He was a very  very young man  a boy really  when he was suspended   White said He showed remorse at the time  admitted to it  He s gone through all the rehabilitation and education as prescribed by the ICC I m personally comfortable with him coming to New Zealand and playing  added White New Zealand s immigration department issued a statement before Christmas saying it had not yet received a visa application for Amir and would consider one when it is received A decision is likely next week

Big financial incentives for gamblers  small tournaments of little consequence to top players and the ease of fixing the outcome of a one on one sport have helped turn world tennis into a haven for match fixers  according to experts and industry insiders Tennis was rocked on Monday by allegations that the games authorities have failed to deal with widespread match fixing  just as the Australian Open  the first grand slam tournament of the year  kicked off in Melbourne Multiple sources told Reuters that the revelation was no surprise to those who closely follow the sport  where  out of the spotlight at small tournaments around the world  the temptations are obvious and malfeasance very difficult to prove Dozens of untelevised tournaments are held annually and top players often inexplicably lose to relatively unknown opponents  said Steve Georgakis  a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney  who is researching match fixing in tennis  If you have a look at the big tournaments  the Opens or Olympic Games  youll notice that in a lot of these tournaments the favourite usually wins   he said But at a small tournament the following week  how could anyone prove that a top    player didnt lose because they were exhausted or injured  said Georgakis A highly ranked player is almost certain to be the odds on favourite to win in these small tournaments and thus has the greatest opportunity to make money by intentionally losing to an outmatched player  handing a big payoff to those behind the fix  Its a one on one sport and what you do is  youre the favourite and you get a few other people to load up on the other player to win and then you throw the match And you can never get caught   Georgakis added Sports betting has exploded in recent years with the proliferation of online and mobile gambling sites  and could be worth as much as    trillion annually  Patrick Jay  an independent betting expert  told the United Nations in      In that sea of money  tennis is the second most active betting market  trailing only soccer  research conducted by the European Gaming and Betting Association shows Betting on tennis is relatively simple and comes with enormous potential payoffs  a professional tennis gambler told Reuters under the condition of anonymity Many bookmakers have created disincentives to bet point by point or game by game with limits on those types of bets  pushing gamblers towards the payoffs for a winning bet on the overall match  Say you want to throw a game but win the match  why would you bother  You can only win a couple of thousand of dollars   the gambler said Bookmakers are obliged to report suspicious betting patterns to the Tennis Integrity Unit  which was set up to police illegal activities in world tennis But a source at a major bookmaker told Reuters under the condition of anonymity that it is ultimately up to the authorities to act  Most money is won by betting on the favourite  which is not a good result for bookmakers   he added  But if hes up one set to love and then  in play  people start betting on the outsiderthat would be us getting on the front foot  most likely  to say  to the authorities  is there anything you need for us to look into    the bookmaker said

 Mitchell Marsh kept calm after New Zealand got the sniff of an unlikely victory and scored his sixth one day international half century to guide Australia to a four wicket win in the second match of their one day series on Saturday The victory levelled the three match series at     with the final game in Hamilton on Monday Australia have not lost a bilateral one day series since India in October       Marsh scored an unbeaten    and combined with John Hastings     not out  in an unbroken    run seventh wicket partnership for the visitors as they overhauled New Zealands     for nine with     overs remaining David Warner top scored with    in Australias        and combined with the recalled Usman Khawaja      in a     run opening stand that had set the foundation for their victory Mitchell Santner had almost taken the game away from the visitors with his left arm spin  breaking the opening partnership and then trapping Warner leg before when the aggressive opener was within sight of his sixth one day century Santner then had Matthew Wade brilliantly caught in the deep by Adam Milne for two to reduce the visitors to     for six in the   rd over and give the hosts a sniff of victory in a game they had not played well enough to win Too many overs were peppered with boundary balls as they struggled with their length on a wicket that had little help for the bowlers They had also not posted a big enough target as their innings suffered from fits and starts with all of the batsmen  apart from Henry Nicholls  laying solid foundations only to fall when they needed to build Kane Williamson top scored with     though the hosts total was only pushed to a score considered defendable courtesy of a    run eighth wicket stand between Santner     not out  and Milne      The    year old Santner  who only made his international debut last year  is quickly impressing as an automatic selection in all formats of the game with his fluid batting and handy left arm spin   Reuters   Saturdays match showcased his blossoming capabilities  with New Zealand slumping to     for six in the   th over and in danger of being bowled out before their full allocation Santner  who was joined by the right handed Milne    runs later  however kept the strike ticking over to put the bowlers off their rhythm  turned singles into twos with hard running and hit the bad ball to the boundary Opening bowler Josh Hazlewood  however  ended the partnership  and stopped New Zealand from edging closer to a more competitive      to finish with      from    overs 
 New Zealand tallied     for   in Wellington despite a much improved Australian bowling and fielding effort in a match the visitors must win to keep the Chappell Hadlee series alive Kane Williamson made a smooth    but it was a late innings partnership of    from    balls between Mitchell Santner and Adam Milne that added heft to the innings after the Australians had claimed regular wickets throughout the afternoon Legspinner Adam Zampa bowled well in his first international match to claim the wickets of Williamson and Grant Elliott  while John Hastings  Josh Hazlewood  Scott Boland and Mitchell Marsh also put in decent shifts with the ball Nevertheless  Australia must perform far more staunchly with the bat than they managed in the series opener at Eden Park if they wish to force a decider at Seddon Park in Hamilton in two days  time  Usman Khawaja  among others  will be eager to make a difference Australia made three changes to the team that was given a hiding in Auckland  dropping Shaun Marsh for Khawaja  while Boland came in for Kane Richardson due to back soreness  and the debutant Zampa was called up in place of the injured James Faulkner  Zampa had his ODI cap presented to him by Allan Border New Zealand  by contrast  were unchanged  in a match where they can complete a series victory over Australia for the first time since       Their captain Brendon McCullum led a typically hyperactive start to proceedings  clattering    from    balls including a six off each of the Australia pacemen Boland s very first ball was sent flying back over his head and into the sight screen  but he responded well by pulling back his length and being rewarded when McCullum charged again and was bowled  That wicket scotched much of the early momentum  even if Martin Guptill and Williamson moved along smoothly enough for the next    overs It was Mitchell Marsh who broke the stand  prompting a miscue from Guptill when he tried to force the pace a little more  The chance swirled out towards deep cover  where Khawaja showed excellent judgment to claim a catch more difficult than it appeared  Marsh had another victim when Henry Nicholls  called up to the Test team this week  wafted at a wide delivery  New Zealand had stalled Williamson and Elliott formed another useful stand without ever looking in total command  This was in part due to the thoughtful work of Zampa  who varied his pace artfully to keep the batsmen guessing  His reward would come in consecutive overs  as first Williamson then Elliott pushed catches to cover as they tried to manufacture boundaries That put New Zealand five down  and regular wickets from there prevented the hosts from pulling together a total of the dimensions they managed at Eden Park  Santner and Milne pulled back some of the ground in the closing overs  but the tourists could be happier with their effort 
 New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum won the toss and chose to bat first against Australia in the second Chappell Hadlee ODI at Westpac Stadium in Wellington Australia made three changes to the team that was given a hiding at Eden Park  dropping Shaun Marsh for Usman Khawaja  while Scott Boland came in for Kane Richardson due to some back soreness  and the debutant Adam Zampa came into the side in place of the injured James Faulkner  Zampa had his ODI cap presented to him by Allan Border New Zealand  by contrast  were unchanged  in a match where they can complete a series victory over Australia for the first time since      The pitch is firm and the weather is pleasant  with plenty of runs in prospect for the afternoon Teams New Zealand  Martin Guptill  Brendon McCullum  captain   Kane Williamson  Henry Nicholls  Grant Elliott  Corey Anderson  Luke Ronchi  wk   Mitchell Santner  Adam Milne  Matt Henry  Trent Boult Australia  Usman Khawaja  David Warner  Steven Smith  captain   George Bailey  Glenn Maxwell  Mitchell Marsh  Matthew Wade  wk   John Hastings  Adam Zampa  Scott Boland  Josh Hazlewood

  Swing and seam friendly conditions  a lack of truly scary Australian bowlers and New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum s retirement are all themes that will resonate when the first test gets underway in Wellington on Friday The Basin Reserve wicket was heavily grassed just    hours out from the toss and  even if brilliant sunshine in New Zealand s capital was expected to brown it off  McCullum and Steve Smith are still likely to ask the opposition to bat Similarly grassed pitches in New Zealand in recent years have not helped the fast bowlers as much as expected  however  as both captains noted on Thursday  I think the wicket will dry out quicker than what you d expect   McCullum said   The first two days will be challenging for the batsmen      and  you have to just hang in there and get a competitive score  It s not going to be the     or     but you just have to be competitive and then the third and fourth innings are where things take shape  Despite having won    of their    previous tests against New Zealand and taken the home encounter     last November  Australia are not overwhelming favourites to win the series and reclaim the number one ranking in test cricket Their pace bowling unit of Peter Siddle  Jackson Bird and new spearhead Josh Hazlewood lacks the blistering speed of the two Mitchells  Starc and Johnson  both of whom created doubt  and at times fear  in the minds of batsmen Hazlewood s ability to swing the ball and Siddle s to seam it off the pitch should create issues for New Zealand but the Australians have shown they are not immune to struggles with similar movement Last year at Trent Bridge  Stuart Broad showed how badly they play the moving ball when he took      as England skittled the tourists for    in their first innings  We haven t been good enough with the bat on wickets that have been doing a bit in the last year or so   Smith said  The wicket here looks like it might do a bit so we ve got a bit to prove and we ve got to adapt accordingly  a lot better than we have in recent times  New Zealand s opening duo Tim Southee and Trent Boult have the ability to swing and seam the ball and while they have been down on pace this summer  recent outings have suggested they are pushing it back into the    kph plus range That pace will be needed to try and put pressure on an Australian side which is likely to retain the aggressive mindset that has characterised their batting in recent years Underpinning the entire series is the fact McCullum will retire after the second test in Christchurch The first match at the Basin Reserve will be his    th test  all of which have been played in succession since his debut in       I m looking forward to these two test matches   McCullum said   It will be a great series  two evenly matched teams  Not a better way to go out really

World crickets most intriguing rivalry will once again be renewed when India take on an unpredictable Pakistan with rehabilitated pacer Mohammed Amir being the focus of attention in a roundrobin league encounter of the Asia Cup T   tournament here today  Saturday  The match will also serve as a precursor to the two teams opening round battle in the ICC World Twenty   next month The IndoPak cricket contests over the years have carried a legacy not to forget the political undercurrents involved whenever the two bitter neighbours square off on the    yards But the most exciting aspect will be whether the tainted Amir gets to play in the XI Back after serving a fiveyear ban for spotfixing Amir has started playing for the national team since the tour of New Zealand and this immensely talented bowler will certainly come out all guns blazing against the Indian batsmen Virat Kohli has already welcomed Amir s return but not much is known as to what other Indian players including skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni think about the convicted spot fixer s inclusion In India  the BCCI has taken a zero tolerance approach imposing life bans on players like S Sreesanth  Ankeet Chavan  Ajit Chandila who have no hopes of returning to competitive cricket For Amir  though a good performance against India will probably help him gain some credibility not only in the dressing room but also among the common cricketloving public in Pakistan In terms of preparation  both teams have been suitably prepared considering the amount of Twenty   cricket they have played in the past one month India already kicked off their World T   preparations in style having won six out of the seven games played so far Pakistan cricketers on the other hand are coming straight after playing in the Pakistan Super League  PSL  which keeps them well prepared Traditionally  India have never ever lost to Pakistan in the global events but it has not been the case in the continental event where Shahid Afridi and co have performed well However the Asia Cup has never been played in the T   format which is also a first   Online 
India and Pakistan will lock horns in the highly anticipated Asia Cup on Saturday at the Shere Bangla National stadium in Mirpur India are hot favourites during the mouth watering encounter  But in T   format its very difficult to predict a winner Pakistani all rounder Shoaib Malik said that though India have the winning momentum  Pakistan could give a tough fight to their old rivals Indian batsmen are very consistent but we have a good bowling attack  This is going to be a great game  This is going to be a big opportunity for players of both the teams  Malik told a leading Hindi news channel Malik  however  made it clear that his wife Sania Mirza would cheer for Team India this weekend We maintain the same status  She supports Team India and wants her husband to do well  perform well in the middle if he is playing  he added

The World Twenty   has provided a stage for Asian sides to flourish in its short history and host India s scintillating form leading up to the tournament will only fuel local hopes that the trend will continue India  Pakistan and Sri Lanka have won three out of the five stagings of the biennial tournament  while the      final was the only one that did not feature a team from South Asia Former players and pundits have been united in endorsing India  who won the    over World Cup at home in       as favourites to add a second World Twenty   title to their cabinet and given the side s run of form  it is hardly surprising Mahendra Singh Dhoni s men have won    of the    Twenty   contests they have played this year  including a     win in Australia  and have looked supremely balanced with their often soft bowling attack also showing plenty of bite The only worry for India s fanatical cricket following will be that the team have peaked too early and they will be desperately hoping that the law of averages catches up with them after the final at Kolkata s Eden Gardens on April   While India have enjoyed a relatively trouble free build up to the tournament  it has been far from smooth sailing for fellow Asian contenders Pakistan and Sri Lanka Pakistan  the      champions  arguably have the most potent pace attack with left arm fast bowler Mohammad Amir seamlessly integrating into the side after a five year spot fixing ban But Shahid Afridi s men have had troubles with their top order  prompting the selectors to twice tinker with the squad and a row over security leading to a venue change for the highly charged India match will not have helped matters Defending champions Sri Lanka have failed to adequately replace retired batting stalwarts Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene after their      World Twenty   triumph and were forced to install Angelo Mathews as their new captain this week The island nation have lost recent series against New Zealand  India and a woeful Asia Cup display led to the sacking of the entire selection panel The team and their supporters will keep their fingers crossed on the fitness of pace spearhead Lasith Malinga  who relinquished the captaincy due to the slow recovery of his injured knee but insists he can still play a part AUSTRALIA S T   CONUNDRUMAustralia will look to end their lack of success in the format and add the T   title to their    over World Cup triumph on home soil last year  banking on their explosive batting line up to make up for the lack of a potent spinner They have not left anything to chance though  replacing Aaron Finch with test and one day international skipper Steve Smith to lead the side  who have had a number of players plying their trade in the Indian Premier League  IPL  over the years Another side hoping the experience of playing in the IPL will come in handy for their players will be South Africa  who once again will be determined to shed their  chokers  tag at another global championship AB de Villiers  believed by most to be the most destructive batsman in world cricket  has often entertained crowds in India during the IPL with his     degree batting and South Africa will hope the    year old can end their wait for a World Cup title FEARLESS ENGLANDJos Buttler  Alex Hales and Eoin Morgan will believe they can be match de Villiers  pyrotechnics for England but the      champions  bowling attack appears short of experience They also have a powerful striker in Ben Stokes and the dependable Joe Root with the willow but it is to be seen if the batting can gloss over their bowling shortcomings Fellow contenders New Zealand may have a few psychological issues to resolve if they are to overcome their tendency to come up short on the big stage Their preparations have been overshadowed by the recent death of former captain Martin Crowe while the retirement of Brendon McCullum has robbed them of an exceptional reader of the game with unbridled batting firepower Darren Sammy will also have to inspire an understrength West Indies team  who just weeks ago were planning to boycott the tournament over a contractual dispute  if the      champions are to stand any chance of winning a second title

South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn has sounded a warning to batsmen at the World Twenty   in India as he prepares to get his sides campaign off to a positive start against England in Mumbai on Friday Steyn recently returned to the South Africa side after an injury plagued season that he says has only increase his resolve to help his side to an elusive major one day trophy Following a     home Twenty   series victory over England last month  the South Africans are brimming with confidence I dont want to say that we have the upper hand but we have beaten them  England  in the shorter format and they do know it  Im fit and strong to play  Steyn told reporters in Mumbai on Wednesday Steyn  who returned to action this month against Australia after groin and shoulder problems  has seen an improvement in South Africas limited overs bowling attack which also includes seamers Kagiso Rabada  Kyle Abbott and Chris Morris When I walked into the side for the Australia series I could see the guys were glowing with confidence  Steyn said I was watching guys who normally sit on the side lines like Kyle Abbott landing their yorkers and slower balls It was great to be out of the side because when I walked back in I realised how much I had missed it and how much these guys have grown as a team  even in that two month gap South Africa play their opening two World Twenty   matches against England and Afghanistan in the seam friendly conditions of the Wankhede Stadium in MumbaiThey then take on West Indies at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur  which produced a rank turner in the game between India and New Zealand on Tuesday Ive always said that I can bowl on any track  Steyn said I prefer the wickets that are slower and turning  The ball stops and makes it tough for batsmen to hit you out of the ground  especially at a ground like Nagpur which is a big ground As a seamer I back myself  I can bowl fast cutters  its difficult to hit the ball out of the ground when its coming at     or     and is gripping and stopping 
India s cricket team is undoubtedly  indisputably  unarguably  and by a massive distance  better than Pakistan s cricket team  At football It was probably the only definitive bit of knowledge anyone could have gleaned from watching the two teams  training sessions on the eve of their World T   clash at the Eden Gardens  If Saturday s big match involved goalposts and a large  inflated ball  India would lose no sleep over it It is  instead  a cricket match  And not just any cricket match  It is the cricket match that causes a spike in the frequency of Venkatesh Prasad sightings on Indian television in the days leading up to it  And of Aamer Sohail and Kiran More and Javed Miandad and Ajay Jadeja and Waqar Younis and Joginder Sharma and Misbah ul Haq It is an India Pakistan clash at a World tournament  and it will come with the inevitable trappings  Famous people will sing national anthems  Massive names will be present among the massive numbers in attendance  Sachin Tendulkar will be there  So will Imran Khan  And Sunil Gavaskar  And Wasim Akram  And Kapil Dev  And Inzamam ul Haq In the middle of all this  India and Pakistan  the cricket teams  will try and tune out the constant swirl of India Pakistan R Ashwin reinforced this during his pre match conference on Friday  in a packed and insufficiently air conditioned media room that evoked the pressure cooker clich  This rivalry is huge   he said   It s very hard to put a finger  on it  and say how huge it is  It s probably bigger than the Ashes is  As far as the Indians go and the Pakistanis go  I don t think they watch this as a game of cricket  It s more of a border rivalry  they want to get one up on each other  So there is much more to this game rather than the game itself taking centrestage  As far as people are concerned  they put their emotions into it  For the players it s about trying to keep the emotions aside and playing the game the best we can  It is something India have invariably managed to do against Pakistan at World events  In six World Cup meetings and four in the World T    they have never lost  It s the sort of record that can put pressure on both sides  but on this occasion India are under more of it  given that they are playing at home  and given that they were beaten soundly by New Zealand in their first game and therefore have to win this one  Over recent years  Pakistan have usually been underdogs going into matches against India  and on this occasion have the cushion of a big win in their opening game against Bangladesh  History can change  too   Waqar Younis  Pakistan s head coach  said   We are confident  a little more this time because  India  can go out of the tournament also  They will be under a lot of pressure  We have to take it positively  We have won the last match  so there are lots of things going in our favour  hopefully  Yes  there is no doubt that our history hasn t been so good but history can always be changed  In all the previous games  the pressure was on Pakistani team  This is the first time that the pressure is more on India   not arising from victory or defeat at the hands of Pakistan but because this is a very big tournament  I have been a cricketer all my years and it is impossible that India won t be feeling the pressure  I am sure they will be feeling the pressure and we are going to take advantage of that  India arrived in Kolkata on Wednesday night  but only had an optional training session   which only Suresh Raina  Ajinkya Rahane and Pawan Negi attended   on Thursday  Their first full session ahead of the match was on its eve  Ashwin said the light schedule was followed to allow the players to relax after the loss to New Zealand  and not put themselves under too much pressure  I think it was more about trying and relaxing   he said   It had nothing to do with who we are playing  what game we are playing and all that  We have been on the road for the last three months and we thought it s time now to sit in the hotel room and revisit what we did in the last game  The best thing that we can do is to think for ourselves than sitting together and practising  What happens after a game like that is we tend to go into nervous practice  try and overdo everything  and eventually end up going into the match a little more tired than we actually should be  That s the idea behind it  India s practice session on Friday reflected this mindset  with the bowlers hardly taxing themselves and only the middle order trio of Yuvraj Singh  MS Dhoni and Hardik Pandya spending any real length of time batting  Pakistan   after their unconvincing footballing warm up   had a more traditional nets session  with the fast bowlers coming off their full run ups and sending down a relatively large quota of deliveries Two training philosophies  neither definitely better or worse than the other  both geared to the same end  to keep minds focused on bat and ball  to tune out the crowds and the last minute venue changes and the razzmatazz of the build up  As Virat Kohli said before the start of the tournament   On the field is the safest and quietest place for you   And until they actually get on the field  the match will live a parallel existence that has little to do with the actual cricket  It might as well be a football game where Mohammad Irfan and a magically young again Venkatesh Prasad are goalkeepers in a penalty shootout 
Australia began their title defence with a six wicket win against South Africa at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur  It was vice captain Alex Blackwell and captain Meg Lanning who led the way to chase down     easily in the end  after they were reduced to   for   in the fourth over South Africa had an excellent launch pad at    without loss in    overs after opting to bat  Then they fell into a crater courtesy rush of blood  indecision against spin and a number of misguided strokes to huff and puff to     for    As hard as they tried  defending it was never going to be easy against the masters of the big occasion who are gunning for their fourth successive title Eventually  the batting meltdown played a big part in the result  as Lanning and Blackwell allayed fears with an unbroken    run fifth wicket stand off just    balls to see Australia home with nine balls to spare South Africa showed they were up for a fight as Dane van Niekerk did the early running by making    in a    run opening stand with Trisha Chetty  before Australia strangulated them While Ellyse Perry hustled the batsmen with pace  Lauren Cheatle s canny variations resulted in South Africa s middle order having to manufacture strokes that didn t connect  Chetty s scratchy    eventually helped them cross the     run mark Australia s thoughts of the chase being a walk in the park were firmly put on the backburner  Alyssa Healy walked across to flick  only to find her leg stump flattened to give the fired up Shabnim Ismail an early sniff  Perry bottom edged a cut to the wicketkeeper  while Ellyse Villani chopped on to leave Australia in tatters before they could reach double figures Lanning s illness that kept her off the field for most parts of South Africa s innings meant she could come in either after    minutes or the fall of the fifth wicket  But the conclusion of Ismail s opening burst took with it the sting in their attack as Blackwell and Jess Jonassen added    for the fourth wicket  When Jonassen stepped out to be stumped  the game was back in the balance as Australia slipped to    for    needing    off    balls Lanning struggled to run as she helped herself to three fours to bring the equation down to    off the last four overs  Once within striking distance  the feared white ball striker in her surfaced as she hit Ismail for two fierce square cuts  to convert a tricky chase into a cruise

Aggressive opening batsman Chris Gayle usually hogs the headlines but West Indies  advance to the World Twenty   final against England has shown they are by no means a one man band  according to batsman Lendl Simmons Gayle scored an unbeaten century in the Caribbean side s first pool match against England  which set up their successful run chase of      reaching the target with    balls to spare in Mumbai  Since then  he has scored nine further runs He was dismissed for five in the semi final against India before Simmons smashed    from    balls  while Andre Russell scored    from    to guide their side into Sunday s showdown with Eoin Morgan s team in Kolkata on Sunday  I think England will certainly be aware that it s not a one man show in this team   Simmons told reporters  Chris Gayle didn t get off but we still managed to get over the line and it was a big total  Even when he didn t perform  we were still able to get up and fight and that shows a lot of character from our players  The team have needed to rely on their character and collective will after a turbulent few months in which they have been pilloried for their performances in test matches and one day internationals They have also been galvanised by yet another bitter pay dispute with their board  who less than two months ago threatened to send a second string side to the tournament in India unless the squad accepted their offer Since Gayle s blistering start to the tournament  others have assumed the mantle of trying to chase down the totals they have been set in all five games Andre Fletcher scored    not out in their seven wicket win over Sri Lanka  while Johnson Charles      and Marlon Samuels      saw them to a three wicket win over South Africa  Every one of our players are match winners in our team   Simmons added   We have a lot of batting power and I think we can chase any run total  we always back ourselves to chase totals  That confidence has also been evident in Morgan s side after they comfortably accounted for New Zealand in the other semi final  with man of the match Jason Roy epitomising the aggressive attitude that has filtered through the team That aggression  and confidence  made them a better outfit than the England team that won the World Twenty   in       according to the captain of that side  Paul Collingwood  In the past our line up probably had one or two players that were real match winners  this team is full of match winners   Collingwood told the ECB website  These guys are mentally different to what we used to be   Who dares wins  is pretty much the motto  We probably would think   this is a big game  and pull back a little bit  It seems to be the other way round for these guys  they seem to thrive on the excitement of the big stage  
West Indies will face a completely different England side in Sundays World Twenty   final compared to the one they beat in the Super    stage match  captain Eoin Morgan said on the eve of the title clash Doubts crept in about Englands prospects in the sixth edition of the tournament after West Indies chased down a     run target at the Wankhede Stadium with almost two overs to spare  riding on an unbeaten century from opener Chris Gayle But the      champions made significant improvement in their last two matches  including a morale boosting victory over an in form New Zealand side in the semi finals  to inch closer to a second T   title  I think its two completely different teams given that we have grown as a side game on game   Morgan told reporters at the Eden Gardens on Saturday  I think its difficult to compare sides from the first game of the tournament to the final of the World Cup  While Gayle is due for a big score having made little impact on the tournament since his blitzkrieg against England  Morgan said England could not afford to only focus on the Jamaican  Even before we played West Indies in the group stages I was quite firm in saying that Chris Gayle wasnt just the West Indies team   said the    year old who is himself due for runs  Its important that when you are playing against good sides you do not focus on one or two good players Its everybody  because anybody can hurt you   Morgan added  I think India witnessed that and everybody watching the game witnessed that with Lendl Simmons innings  Barely    months back  England made an ignominious exit from the    over World Cup and were pilloried for their negative approach to limited overs cricket Morgan credits a change in mindset for their success  I think the strides we have made in the last    months  this would be a great reward for the mindset we have showed and the hard work we have put in   the left handed batsman added  Its quite a stark difference  Its hard to believe in some ways  I would have never imagined the turnaround being so immediate or having such an immediate impact   the key component within that has been the mindset  I think tomorrow the opportunity we do have is a product of that Its totally exciting   I am just very  very proud  Morgan hopes his team mates will not be overawed by the occasion in front of over        spectators at the iconic Eden Gardens  We know its not going to be a normal game  I want all of our players to embrace it and tomorrow everything is going to feel a bit rushed   he said  To start with its important that we are in a really good frame of mind to slow things down when needed and more importantly execute our skills

Lionel Messi s    th career goal couldn t prevent Barcelona s incredible slump in form from continuing with a fourth defeat in five games     at home to Valencia on Sunday Atletico Madrid are now level on    points with Barca at the top of La Liga with five games remaining as they beat Granada      but the Catalans retain the lead thanks to their superior head to head record Third placed Real Madrid are also only a point behind thanks to their     win at Getafe on Saturday Valencia were beaten     by Barca on their last trip to the Camp Nou just two months ago under former boss Gary Neville  but gained revenge thanks to Ivan Rakitic s own goal and Santi Mina s classy finish before half time Messi ended a five game goal drought to bring up his    th for club and country  but couldn t inspire a Barca fightback as their alarming collapse in recent weeks continued after a    game unbeaten run Having looked well set for a second consecutive treble just two weeks ago  Barca could now miss out on all three major trophies as they were dumped out of the Champions League by Atletico in midweek and have taken just one point from their last four La Liga games However  in contrast to recent defeats  Barca boss Luis Enrique praised the performance of his side and believes they are capable of winning their last five games to retain the title  Luck didn t shine on the team  I congratulate my players for how they faced the adversity during the game   said Enrique  We still depend on ourselves  Our margin for error has run out and we are aware of the challenge  Now we have a marvellous challenge  five games in which if we win them all we are champions Barca started brightly  but were repeatedly denied by fine saves from Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves The Brazilian blocked Messi s volley from close range before somehow springing to punch away Neymar s lob which seemed destined to evade him However  Valencia amazingly went in at half time two goals to the good having had just one shot on target The visitors went in front on    minutes when Rakitic turned Guilherme Siqueira s cross into his own net at the near post and doubled their lead thanks to a brilliant move in first half stoppage time as Dani Parejo played in Mina to fire into the far corner Rakitic had a huge chance to make amends for his own goal a minute into the second half  but pulled his effort tamely wide from Luis Suarez s fine cut back However  Barca were finally given hope when Jordi Alba s low cross was turned home by Messi to reach another historic landmark Alves came to Valencia s rescue once more with his best save of the night low to his right to prevent Rakitic equalising    minutes from time Neymar s fiercely struck volley was somehow deflected behind by Shkodran Mustafi  but Valencia should also have killed the game off at the other end when Paco Alcacer miscued from point blank range allowing Sergio Busquets to clear off the line Gerard Pique then had a glorious chance to salvage at least a point late on  but he pulled his shot wide with just Alves to beat In contrast to Barca s collapse  Atletico are flying in the final stages of the season as Fernando Torres struck his fourth goal in as many games in a routine win over Granada  It will be tough  to win the league   but we will play as the schedule demands us to which is to win  win and win again   said Atletico boss Diego Simeone Koke ensured Atletico would have no hangover from their efforts in dispatching Barca from the Champions League in midweek as he swept home the opener on    minutes before teeing up Torres to dink home just before the hour mark Substitute Angel Correa rounded off the scoring with a cool finish seven minutes from time

Batting coach Grant Flower has claimed that Pakistani batsmen are not as hard working as far as fitness is concerned saying our players are very inconsistent with the way they practice Flower said Pakistani batsmen remain in the elusion that whatever they have been doing in order to keep themselves fit is enough for them to excel in the international circuit At the international level most of the guys techniques are sound  With Pakistan  it is more trying to get the routine right but it is also about the preparation off the field regarding fitness  Flower told ESPNCricinfo You not only need that in fielding and bowling but equally in batting  br   If you are physically fit it will definitely lead to a good life style and better judgement at the crease he said Flower said  our players are very inconsistent with the way they practice  They do work on their weak areas but they could do a lot more  When you are an international player you should be waking up and asking yourself what I have to do more to improve myself  If you are not answering that question then I dont think you should be there  he said Flower said that the upcoming camp for the national team ahead of their tour of England will also have a session with a psychologist He said he hopes that the upcoming camp will also cover the psychologist session and the players take that in a positive manner Flower said it requires a lot of sacrifice to play for the country A good student of the game learns everyday life style gym work and all those things required to be a better cricketer  he said He claimed that it is not like    minutes in the gym and    minutes in the nets  br   It is about quality time absorbing everything rather than just being seen doing the right stuff and walking away saying that I have done enough  A lot of guys kid themselves They think they are doing enough to be playing for Pakistan and getting great results  I know a lot of time they are not doing enough  Sometimes I wish they could see how worldclass players prepare and what it takes They watch a lot of cricket but I dont know if they really digest what they see to get to the top  he said  
Paul Hawkins  the inventor of the balltracking HawkEye ball tracking system has now come up with a bat sensor to pick up nicks perfectly  br   The sensor is the size of a small coin and uses an accompanying smart phone app to detect the nicks The on field umpires will have to attach the smart phones to their jackets to film each ball so that instant replays and ball trajectories can be replayed and monitored  a prominent sports website www sportskeeda com reported The tiny sensor which costs     AUD    can easily be fixed to the bat for the phone to film and monitor the ball Hawkins  who was a former county player and a missile guidance expert  has confirmed that the technology is almost ready to be used and might be introduced into amateur cricket in England soon Hawkins had been watching a Hampshire cricket league match last year and had been left very disappointed to see a batsman stand his ground after being out caught behind as the umpire failed to detect the edge That incident has led Hawkins to come up with his ingenious technological innovation to change cricket Batsmen have always not walked but what really got me was that after the inevitable bout of sledging from the fielders the batsman said I know I nicked it and you know I did but so what it wasnt given Hawkins was quoted as saying  More and more batsmen try and get away with it  We got him out soon afterwards but it ruined my day Hawkins technology works much like the realtime Snicko meter with the bat sensor picking up vibrations in the bat and making the results readily available on the smart phones to be worn by the on field umpires We experimented in the nets and found that even the finest edge a feather that the bowler didnt hear is detected  Hawkins said

Rafael Nadal is convinced that none of his rivals are taking performance enhancing drugs and believes that people who have accused him of doping have  personal problems  The Spaniard is suing former French cabinet minister Roselyne Bachelot after she alleged earlier this year that he had failed a drugs test  He used an interview with El Mundo published on Saturday to defend him and other top players I have total confidence that all my rivals are totally clean  he said  I have no doubt about that  first of all because I believe in the anti doping program and secondly because I believe in people until they show you otherwise The    times grand slam winner said that people who have accused him of doping are unhappy with their own lives  and do not like his style of play  They do it because evidently they have a personal problem and are unhappy with themselves  and then they look further  at the technical aspect  perhaps only because of my way of fighting for every point  my style of play  which Ive had throughout my career  Former world number one Nadal  who will attempt to win a   th French Open title this year  strenuously denies ever having taken performance enhancing substances and has never failed a drug test He is taking legal action against Bachelot after she said on French television in March that his seven month absence from the Tour through injury in      was  probably due to a positive doping test  Nadal said he had resisted the urge to take legal action against people who have accused him of doping in the past  but was compelled to act following Bachelot s comments When these things keep being repeated  and someone who is supposed to be in a serious position says something and people start to think that person has privileged information  then it is more serious  he said When someone like that makes gratuitous and false comments with no information  there comes a time when you have to stop and you have to fight because of who you are and what you have been all your life Failed drug tests in elite tennis are rare but doping has been in the spotlight since former women s world number one Maria Sharapova announced in March she had returned a positive test for banned substance meldonium

A diligent half century from Alex Hales  coupled with some home ground know how from Jonny Bairstow  helped England to regroup with a    run stand for the sixth wicket on the first day of the first Test against Sri Lanka  after their ambitions had been dramatically dented by the loss of five wickets for    runs either side of the lunch break By tea  Hales was unbeaten on     his second Test half century in nine innings and his highest yet  beating the    he made against South Africa at Cape Town in January At the other end was Bairstow  who arrived at the crease with England s innings in crisis at    for    but responded with the sort of sparky counter punching  Bairstow s    not out from    balls took the attack back to Sri Lanka  who nevertheless remained firmly in the contest at     for    thanks to Dasun Shanaka s sensational debut breakthroughs After being put into bat on a morning when bowling first was a no brainer for both captains  England s openers were obliged to rein in the extravagant strokeplay that has coloured so much of their cricket in recent months   a situation that might have been tailor made for Alastair Cook  He began the match needing another    runs to reach        Test runs  and after getting off the mark with a sixth ball clip for four through midwicket  appeared well set for the long grind until Shanaka s introduction  in the   th over of the day  tore up the pre conceived script Shanaka launched his Test career with a maiden before striking with the first ball of his second over  Cook had been leaving the ball with his usual sangfroid for most of his    deliveries  but having creamed one cover drive off Nuwan Pradeep  he was drawn into another from the slower  wobblier Shanaka  The full length outside off left him a touch  and Cook scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal  the keeper  He was gone for     and still needs another    runs to notch up a landmark that has been on his conscience since the start of the South Africa tour in December Three balls later  however  such thoughts had been whisked out of England s minds  Nick Compton   whose anxieties cannot have been aided by his team mates  struggles to impose themselves   poked with caution at a perfect off stump line and length  to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip  He was gone for a duck as Shanaka became only the third bowler in Test history  and the first since Richard Johnson in       to claim two wickets before conceding his first career run And  as if that was not enough of an impact on debut  Shanaka then added England s main man to his tally  as Joe Root   in such golden touch in all formats   was also drawn into a drive that scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip It was a dream start for Shanaka  who had been awarded his Test cap by Mahela Jayawardene before the start of play  and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too  who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad  their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago  will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury By tea  however  Hales and Bairstow had provided their team with a steadying hand  as a forecast rain shower swept in from the Pennines to delay the resumption of play 
Alastair Cooks bid to become the first England batsman to reach        Test runs had been relegated to an afterthought by lunch on the first morning of the first Test at Headingley  as the Sri Lanka debutant Dasun Shanaka claimed three wickets for one run in the space of eight balls to cut a swathe through England s much heralded top order By lunch  Cook had been dismissed for      still    runs shy of his landmark   with Nick Compton and Joe Root  the local hero and newly crowned England Test player of the year  both following for ducks in a sensational ten minute spell before lunch It was left to Alex Hales  who had been growing in confidence on    after an anxious first hour  and England s own debutant  James Vince  to glue the innings together  Vince had yet to get off the mark after    balls of watchful defence  as England settled for a lunchtime scoreline   and a definite bout of indigestion   of    for   Shanaka had been brought on to bowl the   th over of the innings with England apparently looking solid on    for   after Cook and Hales had seen off the new ball danger of Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep Instead  having launched his Test career with a maiden  Shanaka struck with his seventh delivery to tempt Cook with a fuller length outside off  and scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal  the keeper Then  three balls later  Compton poked with caution at a perfect off stump line and length  to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip Shanaka then added England s main man to his tally  as Root   in such golden touch in all formats   was also drawn into a drive as Shanaka s wobbly medium pace left his shot just a fraction and scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip instead It was a dream start for Shanaka and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too  who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad  their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago  will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury The second hour of the session also featured a lively but unsuccessful introduction for Sri Lanka s pacy young quick bowler  Dushmantha Chameera  as well as a typically accurate probe from the spinner  Rangana Herath  whose solitary over was blocked out for a maiden by Hales before the break Both sides are wearing black armbands in recognition of the floods that are currently affecting Sri Lanka 
Pakistan head coach Mickey Arthur feels that if there would be a role for Shahid Afridi in Pakistan cricket then he will be brought back Mickey said Afridi has been a fantastic player for Pakistan for many years and you don t discard phenomenal players like that very easily If we think there is a role for him we will certainly bring him back but that is a discussion for the future and another time There s a lot of cricket to be played before we get to that discussion he told Pakpassion net Speaking about Pakistan struggling in twenty   cricket Mickey said one learns a lot from franchise cricket tournaments Not playing in the Indian Premier League  IPL  could be affecting the performances of the Pakistan team in the twenty   over format  he said He further said that the Head Coach should be part of the selection panel I think the Head Coach has a role to play on that panel but it is also good in some instances that you have people who are part of the team environment also selecting otherwise you select for now and forget about the future  he said Mickey said working with three different captains in Pakistan cricket would be a little bit difficult I will discuss it with chief selector Inzamam ul Haq and see what he thinks is the best way forward and we will go from there Ideally you want two captains as a maximum across the three formats That is something we will look at even if it is three different captains that can be fine We will do what is best  he said Talking about plans with the Pakistan Cricket Board  PCB  hesaid he always likes to have goals and targets set for him and the team But again they will be small and little steps to start with You have to crawl before you walk or run I will keep assessing those goals and as we move up I will be able to assess the goals and standards we want  he said

The concept of day night test found a new taker in England with board chairman Colin Graves confirming the country will host a twilight test Australia and New Zealand played the first floodlit test last November at Adelaide Oval and the innovation is taking roots across Asia India and Pakistan are scheduled to play day night tests this year while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are considering following suit pending the results of domestic trials  Full Story   You can t turn your back on it  it will happen   England and Wales Cricket Board Chairman Graves told BBC Sport  We just have to decide when it is going to happen  We re doing a lot of work on it and we d love to see day night cricket  The first floodlit test at Adelaide Oval lasted only three days raising doubts if the pink ball can last the duration of the required number of overs in an innings But the test also attracted more than         fans through the gates at the picturesque ground  a welcome sight at a time when the game s longest format is grappling with dwindling crowds with the advent of the shortest Twenty   format England has also attempted a minor shake up by proposing a points based system to determine the winner of their home series against Sri Lanka beginning on Thursday The points based system is aimed at injecting more excitement into the tour and add context to matches that otherwise maybe of merely academic interests Graves said work needed to be done to make the longest format more exciting and relevant  We have to make test cricket meaningful and we have to put some  oomph  behind it   Graves said  Test cricket is safe if we do something about it  but I don t think it is safe if we do nothing  That is not an option  The International Cricket Council are looking at it and the other countries are looking at it

Sevilla conjured up a dazzling comeback to clinch a record third successive Europa League title on Wednesday  flooring Liverpool with a     victory that showed why the Spanish side have become masters of Europe s second tier competition Sevilla captain Coke lifted the trophy at Basel s St Jakob Park having been the architect of their heroics  scoring twice to leave Liverpool gasping on the canvas after Kevin Gameiro had cancelled out Daniel Sturridge s opener It was a remarkable turnaround after Liverpool had dominated the first half so completely that Juergen Klopp s side should have been home and dry  but they failed to inflict further damage when their opponents were reeling Unai Emery s team hit back with three goals in    minutes  the first coming just    seconds after the interval  to claim the trophy for the fifth time in    seasons and become the first side in    years to win three consecutive European competitions  At Sevilla we love this competition and we love it so much and we want it so much that we won it   Emery said   It is our competition and we underlined that once again  For Liverpool and Klopp  who has now suffered successive final defeats in his seven months in charge after February s League Cup disappointment  it was a dispiriting occasion His team s hopes of Champions League qualification were dashed  leaving Liverpool to face up to a season with no European competition  The players are still young   Klopp told reporters   We will use this experience today and someday everyone will say Basel was a decisive moment for Liverpool FC  It had looked  however  like being an entirely different outcome at the interval The opening goal arrived after    minutes and was a genuine moment of class from Sturridge  who received the ball on the left edge of the area before expertly picking his spot with a pin point curling finish off the outside of his left boot The England striker had already had a header hacked off the line and Liverpool had two vociferous penalty appeals for handball waved away by referee Jonas Eriksson as they turned the screw on their opponents The halftime whistle came to Sevilla s rescue  however  allowing them to regroup before clawing themselves off the ropes with an immediate sucker punch Seconds had elapsed before Liverpool left back Alberto Moreno  whose mistakes have cost his side on a number of occasions this season  darted hopelessly into a tackle on Mariano Ferreira  who skipped past him and crossed for Gameiro to side foot into an empty net Then it was Liverpool s turn to hit the panic button as Gameiro wasted two further chances before Coke added a second after    minutes Vitolo danced through a series of Liverpool tackles before the ball landed invitingly for the Sevilla skipper to curl his finish into the corner The final nail in Liverpool s coffin sparked fury on the touchline as Coke kept his cool to bury his second goal beneath Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet  only for the linesman to briefly raise his flag before putting it down again After some pushing and shoving the goal stood  leaving Liverpool with a mountain to climb Having retreated so far into their shell  however  they were incapable of rising above base camp

Jonny Bairstow brought up his second Test century  and his first on his home ground at Headingley  as England continued their fightback on the second morning of the first Test against Sri Lanka  However  with Alex Hales falling short in his own quest for three figures  Sri Lanka battled back with three wickets in the second hour of the session  and will be armed with a brand new ball when play resumes after lunch Continuing the theme that Hales and Bairstow had established on the first afternoon  the pair extended their sixth wicket stand to     to banish the memories of England s top order wobble  when five wickets had tumbled for    runs  Bairstow was once again the aggressor  as befits a man in supreme form on his Yorkshire home ground   his last two innings at the venue have been     and     Bairstow outscored his partner by three to one throughout their morning resumption  capitalising on too much width as both Sri Lanka openers  Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep  offered opportunities to fillet the third man boundary  He did enjoy one clear moment of good fortune however  on     when Pradeep failed to gather a sharp return catch to his right  as Bairstow scuffed a drive back down the track At the other end  Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining    runs he needed for his maiden Test century  It was a grind  as he routinely refused to chase anything outside his eyeline  except for one clear opportunity on     when Dimuth Karunaratne failed to cling onto a flying edge at slip off the bowling off Angelo Mathews It could have been the slice of luck that Hales needed  But four runs later  and faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack  Hales  patience snapped for good  In Herath s second over  he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers  A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover  who pouched the offering with a well judged dive Hales was visibly distraught  lingering at the crease for several seconds and looking as though he wanted to snap his errant bat in two  Though he belatedly acknowledged the crowd as he dragged himself from the field  he knew that he had thrown away a priceless opportunity to silence those who doubt his credentials as a Test match opener It could have set his summer up at the first opportunity  Instead  having added    runs to his overnight    in    deliveries  with a dropped catch thrown in the mix as well  he will know that the jury remains out  At least  for those of a superstitious bent  he had guaranteed his fate would be different to the last two England openers to make a maiden Test hundred at Headingley   both Sam Robson        and Adam Lyth        were out of the side by the end of the summer If Hales  failing had been to linger too long  then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali  England s No    had admitted before the match that he had lost a bit of confidence in being slated to come in so low for his country  but the hasty manner in which he came and went didn t exactly enhance his case for a promotion  He had failed to score from his first seven deliveries when he drove too firmly at his eighth  from Dushmantha Chameera  and lobbed a simple catch off the inside edge and pad  to Kusal Mendis under the helmet at short leg It was a timely reward for the slippery Chameera  bowling only his second over of the day  He had erred on the short side in his fruitless first day s work  but was soon celebrating two wickets in the space of five deliveries when Stuart Broad drove flat footedly at a hint of width outside off and spread eagled his own stumps via an inside edge Bairstow simply stared down the track  rather nonplussed by the clatter of wickets in his midst  But he didn t have to wait long to reframe the story of the session  From the first ball of Chameera s next over  Bairstow drilled a drive into the covers  paused as a wild shy came in at the non striker s end  then galloped through with glee as the ball zipped through for overthrows to gift him his second century and his first on home soil  Coming at the ground where his late father  David  played for so many years  it was a moment that he may yet cherish even more than his emotional first century  at Cape Town five months ago 
England and Wales Cricket Board  EWCB  director Andrew Strauss has announced that a points system crossing all formats will be used for the matches against Sri Lanka and Pakistan this summer The Super Series will get underway when the international summer begins with the first Test between England and Sri Lanka at Headingley on Thursday As is traditional individual series trophies will still be atstake for the Tests oneday internationals and oneoff Twenty  internationals against both tourists But a system will also be introduced whereby the sides can earn four points for a Test win  two for a draw and two for a victory in one of the whiteball matches www skysports com reported An overall win may therefore possibly not be achieved until the final match in each series which will be the Twenty   matches in the case of this summers tours and an unsponsored prize of        will be put up by the home board  The idea is Strauss own and he outlined the thinking behind it at Headingley on Wednesday Today Im introducing the Super Series the winner of which will be the overall tour winner for the Sri Lanka and Pakistan series over all formats  said the former England captain The rationale is that the game of cricket is evolving unbelievably quickly and I think we feel responsibility to ensure the international game develops  Central to that is context and relevance for every game of cricket you play  We believe the Super Series will provide that by connecting the formats and ensuring every game counts for something more than just itself Two separate whiteball teams and a redball team will be connected by something greater than their own immediate interests  What this doesnt do is replace any of the individual series awards this summer so there will still be a Test series victory plus the one day series and the Twenty   match as well  But it sits on top of that wraps around it and creates something bigger to aim for The ECB is very keen to be at the fore front of efforts to modernise the international game and we feel this is a good way of ensuring the game remains relevant in both fans and players minds If the same points formula had been applied to Englands winter tours  the outcome would have been decided in the last match and the Test series winners would have been pipped at the line  Of course we would love the final game to be a Super Series decider that would be perfect  said Strauss If you look at the last two series we played  against South Africa we would have lost the Super Series in the final Twenty   and against Pakistan in the UAE we would have won the Super Series in the super over in the final Twenty    Anyone out there who doesnt see the need for international cricket to keep moving forwards really does have their head stuck in the sand I think we have to be on the front foot on this and say look we have a very vibrant Test support in this country and weve seen some fantastic Test matches over the last       months but there are some worrying signs there  so lets act before its too late

Manchester United sacked manager Louis van Gaal on Monday after an FA Cup triumph failed to make up for the club s inability to qualify for the Champions League amid widespread discontent with a season of insipid performances The Dutchman was dismissed two days after United s win over Crystal Palace in the Wembley Cup final  their first trophy in three years  paving the way for the widely expected appointment of former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho as his successor News of Van Gaal s impending departure from the club leaked out minutes after Saturday s     extra time victory over Palace and  following relentless media speculation and a day of negotiations  it was confirmed by both sides on Monday evening  I d like to thank Louis and his staff for their excellent work in the past two years culminating in winning a record equalling   th FA Cup for the club   executive vice chairman Ed Woodward said in a statement on the website of the club owned by the American Glazer family  www manutd com   He has behaved with great professionalism and dignity throughout his time here  He leaves us with a legacy of having given several young players the confidence to show their ability on the highest stage  Van Gaal  though gushing in his appreciation of the chance to manage the club  was not so happy to be moving on  I am very disappointed to be unable to complete our intended three year plan   he said  It has been an honour to manage such a magnificent club as Manchester United FC  and in doing so  I have fulfilled a long held ambition  I have been privileged during my management career to have won    trophies but winning the FA Cup  which is steeped in so much history  will always be one of the most special achievements of my career  That success  however  could not gloss over a season in which United finished fifth in the standings  missing out on Champions League qualification  and where dull performances had the fans booing their own team even after victories DISGRUNTLED FANSAfter replacing David Moyes two years ago  Van Gaal got the team into the Champions League in his first season However  United s inability to produce the free flowing football that characterised Alex Ferguson s trophy laden reign eventually caused a rift throughout the club and in the stands For generations of fans brought up to expect high octane attacking football  Van Gaal s stultifying approach was hard to swallow  particularly when it did not work well  after he spent almost     million pounds          million  on players This season s dire statistics  beyond the key one of fifth place  are a damning indictment of the Dutchman s tactics United scored    goals in    games  in contrast to their previous Premier League average of over    and fourth placed Manchester City s    They had the joint highest number of goalless draws in the division  while Opta noted that United s     shots on target was   th in the    team league and they made more backward passes than any other side It was not just supporters who were disgruntled either A story in Monday s Guardian newspaper said squad members had talked among themselves about openly defying the Dutchman s rigid tactical directions  which allegedly included instructions to players not to take first time shots It also reported that the two most senior players  Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick  had raised concerns with Van Gaal about his post match  evaluation sessions  in which he publicly criticised players in front of their team matesWIDESPREAD DISSATISFACTIONWith such widespread dissatisfaction it easy to forget that the    year old former Ajax Amsterdam  Barcelona  Bayern Munich and Netherlands coach was seen as the safe option when he was hired by United in May      following Moyes s sacking He got the club back in the Champions League with a fourth place finish but  despite heavy spending on the likes of Memphis Depay  Anthony Martial and Bastian Schweinsteiger  United stagnated after topping the table at the end of September French striker Martial apart  the new players struggled to justify their fees  and Van Gaal increasingly turned to talented youngsters such as Marcus Rashford  who has rapidly emerged from United s youth team to earn a place in the England squad By mid December United were out of the top four after successive defeats by promoted clubs Bournemouth and Norwich City and they exited the Champions League after finishing third in a modest group behind VfL Wolfsburg and PSV Eindhoven At home to Southampton United were booed off the pitch and in Denmark the supporters  already frustrated by finding their team playing in the Europa League  chanted obscenities about how bad Van Gaal s side were in a     loss to FC Midjytlland Despite recovering with a     win in the second leg  United then lost to Liverpool in the round of    A late challenge for fourth place  the Cup run and the fan pleasing introduction of the youngsters  bought Van Gaal time but in the bigger picture it was not enough to change the mood Hovering in the background since his sacking in December has been Mourinho  once the scourge of Old Trafford for Porto and Chelsea but now seemingly about to be welcomed with open arms The Portuguese is hardly a graduate of the swashbuckling school of football himself but his remarkable record of success across Europe  combined with a larger than life personality  mean that  if he is appointed  United fans will at least be able to look forward to next season rather than dreading it

English football s biggest club seem to have secured the services of the sport s most colourful manager after Jose Mourinho  according to Sky TV reports  agreed personal terms with Manchester United on Tuesday After a trophy laden career with Porto  Chelsea  Inter Milan and Real Madrid  Mourinho is set to replace Dutchman Louis van Gaal  who was sacked on Monday  with a remit to bring back the glory days the club once took for granted under Alex Ferguson The    year old  sacked by Chelsea in December seven months after winning his third Premier League title at the London club over two spells  had been constantly linked with the United job as Van Gaal struggled to make an impression at Old Trafford The Dutchman was dismissed two days after steering United to their first FA Cup success in    years when they beat Crystal Palace     after extra time in Saturday s Wembley final Van Gaal s preferred possession dominated playing style at a club more readily associated with fast  direct attacking  was widely criticised  and it appeared to take his players time to adapt Mourinho is also known for pragmatism  however  relying on a strong defensive foundation and hard working midfielders and strikers He has a history of success wherever he has managed and a proven track record in the English game Mourinho won the UEFA Cup and Champions League as well as the domestic double twice in his two seasons at Porto and led Chelsea to their first top flight title in    years in his first campaign  retaining it the following season He also won the League Cup and FA Cup before moving to Inter where he won Serie A as well as the Champions League and Italian Cup Mourinho helped Real to their first La Liga crown in four years and on returning to Chelsea  he again won the Premier League before an unexpectedly poor    and troubled    start to the         season led to his sacking DIVIDED OPINIONHis imminent appointment at Old Trafford  touted in the media for months  will divide opinion but while some have voiced concern over playing style and potentially explosive personality clashes  he is widely considered to be as close to a guarantee of silverware as a manager can be The challenge will be not only to deliver success but to do it in style Van Gaal s FA Cup triumph was not enough to allow him to see out the final year of his contract on the back of a season in which the club s fans routinely voiced their frustration with the safety first football being served up Mourinho is not known for throwing caution to the wind but fans will hope that under his leadership United will at least not again be ranked top in the Premier League for the number of backwards passes made as they were under Van Gaal There will also be pressure for the new man to continue the good work of his predecessor in bringing young players such as Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard to the fore  something else Mourinho has singularly failed to do at most of his previous clubs However  after three seasons without a league title and with no Champions League football for a second time in three years  the United hierarchy are evidently prepared to accept potential downsides if the  Special One  gets the club back to what they consider to be their rightful place at the sport s top table Former Old Trafford goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel believes the Portuguese  could save  the club while Hull City manager Steve Bruce  who used to play in front of the Dane in central defence  said the chance to bring in Mourinho was  too good to miss  Former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti  who will coach Bayern Munich next season  said Mourinho would be a  fantastic signing   adding United had  lost its identity this last year  Former Old Trafford great Eric Cantona  however  said his old team should have gone for incoming Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola instead  saying he  loved  Mourinho but that his style of play is  not Manchester United  Retired Dutch international Ronald de Boer believes Mourinho is  similar  to Van Gaal in being a  workaholic  who  prepares perfectly on how to win  De Boer  who worked with Van Gaal at Ajax Amsterdam and with both men at Barcelona  said of Mourinho   Sometimes it is not pretty but he knows how to grind out wins  That is what you get

For Andy Murray  reaching Sunday s French Open final was a bonus  but he was in no mood to look for silver linings in the aftermath of yet another grand slam reverse at the hands of Novak Djokovic The second seeded Briton s                 defeat on Court Philippe Chatrier was his fifth loss in seven blue riband finals against the Serbian world number one  and his eighth out of    finals in all  I was struggling  I was a couple of points from going out of the tournament in the first round   he told reporters  But then when you get there  to the final  obviously you want to win  You know  I didn t do that today  Right now I m very disappointed  Had he turned the tables on a player he has beaten just twice in the past    meetings  Murray would have become the first British man to win the French Open since Fred Perry in      The last of those rare Murray victories came in May s Italian Open final  also played on clay    a surface the Scot once mistrusted but now looks increasingly at ease on    and in the same damp conditions that dominated this year s Roland Garros fortnight Facing a Paris crowd heavily favouring his opponent in a stadium dotted on all sides with Serbian flags  the Scot managed to carry that momentum into the early part of Sunday s match    one he said after his semi final win over Stan Wawrinka that he had  never expected to reach  Murray won    of    points at one stage of the first set But after failing to convert a break point in the first game of the second set  Murray lost the initiative and Djokovic kicked into a higher gear The Serbian faltered only at the sharp end of the match  nervously dropping serve at     as the prospect of winning his fourth major in a row began to sink in  but sealing the match two games later GRACIOUS AND WITTYWhen it was all over  Murray crossed the net to embrace his rival  well aware of the immensity of an achievement he paid tribute to in a gracious  witty courtside speech  Winning all four of the grand slams in one year is an amazing achievement  This is something that is so rare in tennis   he said     So everyone here who came to watch is obviously extremely lucky to see it  Me personally being on the opposite side  it sucks to lose the match  But I am proud to have been part of today  Murray acknowledged that same sense of perspective might help him view his achievements in a kinder light at the end of his career  having shared top four billing over many years with Djokovic and two other all time greats of the game in Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal  Federer missed this year s tournament with a back problem and Nadal had to pull out with a wrist injury after the second round  Obviously the guys I have been around the last few years have made things difficult for me   he said  But I guess I ve got a few more years to try and  win more slams   I think when I finish I will be more proud of my achievements maybe  Meanwhile next month s Wimbledon beckons  and another chance to set the record straight    this time on a surface on which the Serbian has never beaten him

Stuart Broad has insisted he wont have any issues playing against Mohammad Amir should the convicted spot fixer make his Test return at Lords next month Lords was the venue six years ago when left arm quick bowler Amir and two Pakistan team mates were involved in the deliberate bowling of no balls as part of a newspaper sting operation to demonstrate the trios willingness to take part in spot fixing A teenager at the time and one of world crickets undoubted rising stars  Amir was sent to jail by an English court and banned from all cricket worldwide for five years He has now served that ban and  unlike      Pakistan captain Salman Butt and fellow paceman Mohammad Asif  Amir has now been included in the squad for a four Test series starting at Lords on July    Team officials are optimistic the    year old will receive his British visa in the next couple of days following a special request for leniency from the Pakistan Cricket Board The      match  which England won by an innings  is now best remembered for the spot fixing controversy rather than Broads impressive      his lone Test hundred  could rankle with the England fast medium bowler But Broad  speaking at an event organised by England sponsor Hardys wine on Monday  said   I dont think any feelings will be dragged into this Test match from that one  There are only four players in  this  England team from then  and Pakistan had a huge change over  So I dont think any ill feeling or negativity from the players will have carried through  Turning to Amirs possible return  Broad said   I think hes served his time  For quality of bowler  I dont think there is much doubt that he is up there with anyone  Ive not played him for six years  but in      he was a constant threat and man of the series  It swung round corners for him  However  citing the reaction of spectators at Lords to England all rounder Ben Stokes controversial dismissal for obstructing the field in a one day international against Australia last year  Broad said spectators at the home of cricket may not welcome Amir back with open arms  The crowd might be a different story  There was a lively reaction to Ben Stokes dismissal last year to Mitchell Starc  and it looked like a nasty atmosphere for a while  Result devaluedAs for his      hundred  which surpassed the highest Test score achieved by his father Chris  a former England opening batsman  Broad does not feel it was tainted by the spot fixing furore  I do look back at it  and Im very proud of scoring a hundred at Lords  and beating my dads highest score   Its certainly not devalued in my mind  I still scored those runs and  Im  still on the honours board  Nevertheless  he added   I think the result was devalued  We couldnt celebrate  we didnt celebrate  it was all a very strange time  The one day series that followed was quite unpleasant  and the crowds reflected the bad feeling  The ongoing England Sri Lanka series has seen Broad displaced as the worlds top ranked Test bowler by new ball colleague James Anderson Andersons    wickets in the opening two matches have been central to England going     up in a three match series ahead of this weeks third Test against Sri Lanka at Lords starting on Thursday  Its a lovely accolade for our partnership that weve both managed to climb up the rankings like that   said Broad  who has now dropped down to third place in the standings  Its great to have a little bit of competition  and we are both really competitive guys

Cricket South Africa  CSA  have overcome their initial hesitancy and confirmed on Wednesday that the third and final test of the tour of Australia will be a day night fixture at Adelaide Oval starting on Nov     The Proteas had been reluctant to be involved in a day night match having never played with a pink ball but with two warm up matches under lights planned for the October November tour  CSA said they were now willing to play the fixture  Following careful consideration and engagement with all our test players  and acknowledging the need to exploit the potential of playing day night test match cricket  I am pleased to announce that we have agreed with Cricket Australia to proceed with this fixture   CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement on Wednesday  Our Proteas were initially hesitant to play such a key test match without previous experience and adequate preparation but after working through all their concerns and the possible options to prepare sufficiently  there is new found excitement for this novel test match  South Africa captain AB de Villiers added that the major concern for the players was having adequate preparation with a pink ball  We were never against this exciting concept but only wanted to give ourselves the best opportunity of competing in conditions that will be new and foreign to us   he said  Two warm up matches will hopefully give us an idea of what to expect and hopefully our preparations will help us to adapt accordingly  This will be the first time that our players in the test squad will play pink ball test match cricket in front of such a large crowd and to be part of this novel concept will no doubt be a landmark moment in all of our careers  The first day night test was played between Australia and New Zealand in Adelaide last year and drew         spectators despite only lasting three days The highest score in all four innings was      with Australia winning by three wickets 
For someone who has spent six agonising months on the sidelines battling doping allegations  Sri Lankan Kusal Perera cannot think of a better place for his return than the hallowed turf of Lords in the third and final test against England on Thursday The    year old wicketkeeper batsman was sent home from the tour of New Zealand in December after it was announced he had failed a drugs test last July He was cleared last month when the International Cricket Council  ICC  dropped all charges against him after the Qatar based laboratory that conducted the test withdrew its initial findings Perera was not allowed to train with Sri Lanka Cricket  SLC  coaches and was called up in England only after a shoulder injury had ended paceman Dhammika Prasads tour  I havent been told if Im playing yet but I was thrown into trouble and to come back from that at Lords would be a great opportunity   Kusal told reporters at Lords after practice on Tuesday  I was banned just before a test  so to return in this format would be fitting Even the time I was out of the team I knew I hadnt done anything wrong But these things can happen in life  Perera  who has played three tests and    one dayers  admitted he arrived in England undercooked  having barely trained before a series he did not expect to be involved in  I didnt have any time to think about whether I was in touch  or whether I could train  or even what was happening in cricket  I started training the day after I was cleared Before then I didnt do much batting    just some fitness work  Perera  however  felt he was fresh and striking the ball well  which might help his team salvage some pride after batting collapses in Leeds and Chester le Street helped the hosts open an unassailable     series lead  I watched the attack and its mostly fast bowlers   he said of Englands bowlers  In London  the conditions seem easier  because it must have been very cold in Durham  When its cold you are a bit stiff and your feet dont work as well With this weather and given the pitch as well    which looks like it will be batting friendly    I think theres a chance for us to dominate them

PROVIDENCE  GUYANA  South Africa roared back into contention in the Tri Nation One Day International series with a    run victory over Australia in the third match of the tournament at the Guyana National Stadium on Tuesday Defending a modest     for nine on another pitch that challenged the patience and technique of all batsmen  the Proteas bowlers were resisted only by opener Aaron Finchs defiant    before he was ninth out as the World Cup holders folded for     off      overs By virtue of their margin of victory  South Africa also earned a bonus point and leapt from last to first on net run rate over Australia  leaving hosts West Indies third Competition resumes in St Kitts on Saturday with South Africa and Australia renewing their rivalry at Warner Park Farhaan Behardiens workmanlike innings of    held South Africas innings together and earned him the  Man of the Match  award  However pacer Kagiso Rabada shared the plaudits with a useful unbeaten    as the tail contributed important runs and then led the way with the ball as he claimed three for    off seven probing overs Rabada disposed of Usman Khawaja in his opening spell and returned to account for wicketkeeper batsman Matthew Wade and tailender Nathan Coulter Nile in an excellent display of controlled fast bowling  His effort was supported by Wayne Parnell  who shared the new ball and got rid of the dangerous David Warner in his very first over Playing his first ODI for almost    months  Parnell then trapped Australian captain Steve Smith leg before Spinners Imran Tahir and Aaron Phangiso then tightened the stranglehold with two wickets apiece  while Tabraiz Shamsi  the left arm leggie  marked his debut with the wicket of Glenn Maxwell in his first over to ensure there was no escape for the Aussies  We started well with the two seamers although this wasnt the kind of surface where they were having the time of their lives   captain A B  de Villiers said    Tabraiz  Shamsi was a handful for their batters  I didnt see a lot of them picking him    Tough games coming up  Earlier  Australias fast bowling pair of Coulter Nile and Josh Hazlewood proved most effective with two wickets each in restricting the Proteas after de Villiers surprisingly chose to bat first on winning the toss  We didnt adapt well enough with the bat today   was Smiths assessment of his teams reply   Weve got a couple of tough games ahead of us now and we have to improve on this effort  Coulter Nile  who replaced Mitchell Starc from the opening victory over West Indies two days earlier  made the most of the opportunity with a spell of two for    off    overs He claimed the vital wickets of de Villiers and J P  Duminy in consecutive overs to reduce the South Africans to     for five midway through the innings  effectively killing off any realistic chance they had of posting a formidable total Hazlewood was even more economical in conceding    runs off    metronomic overs  He earned an LBW verdict against Quinton de Kock to break the opening partnership with Hashim Amla and returned to get rid of Parnell South Africa entertained hopes of a challenging total when de Villiers and Amla were at the crease  The two most experienced batsmen in the side put on    for the third wicket before Amla was run out for the third time in ODIs against Australia Wickets continued to fall regularly thereafter and it was left to the lower order players Phangiso and Rabada to assist Behardien in lifting the South Africans closer to the     run mark

Germany may have won their opening Euro      game against Ukraine     on Sunday  with talismanic captain Bastian Schweinsteiger scoring late  but the victory also highlighted the need for defensive repairs The world champions looked to be heading in the right direction when defender Shkodran Mustafi  starting in place of the injured Mats Hummels  headed them into the lead from a free kick  something they had worked on in the run up to the tournament However  instead of sitting back and relaxing  Germany coach Joachim Loew had to wait until stoppage time for his team to secure victory when Schweinsteiger netted just minutes after coming on as a substitute Group C rivals Ukraine sliced open Loew s makeshift rearguard time and again in the first half with Mustafi and Jerome Boateng failing to work well together Boateng did produce a spectacular goalline clearance but full backs Jonas Hector and Benedikt Hoewedes also struggled to contain the speed of wingers Andriy Yarmolenko and Yevhen Konoplyanka The German defence was always going to be problematic with Hoewedes and Boateng only recently back from long injury absences Hummels  Boateng s partner in the middle during their      World Cup triumph in Brazil  is temporarily sidelined while fellow centre back Antonio Ruediger was ruled out of the Euros with torn knee ligaments Ukraine were unable to sustain the same tempo after the break but their display showed Germany they will need to raise their game against Poland on Thursday BETTER ORGANISED We had to make adjustments in defence   said Loew   We lost a lot of possession in the first half  In the second half we were better organised and had more control of the ball  Mustafi s stoppage time header back to keeper Manuel Neuer that almost gifted the Ukrainians a goal was indicative of the overall performance in defence  It was an open game  a flowing game   said Mustafi   We had a situation where we were open    it was a game we did not want  Germany will draw confidence from Schweinsteiger s never say die attitude  with the holding midfielder s presence crucial to the team s overall spirit Schweinsteiger has been injured for months  with his very participation in the Euros in doubt  and his goal could not have come at a better time to inspire the squad as they bid to win the competition for the fourth time  We know now that we have to raise our level and hopefully we will do it for Poland   said Neuer

St  KITTS  Australia vice captain David Warner has a fractured left index finger  the team announced on Sunday Opening batsman Warner suffered the injury while fielding during Saturdays victory over South Africa in the triangular one day series in St Kitts  We will assess the situation over the coming days to see if the injury requires a surgical option but should that not be the case then David is likely to be available to return to play in somewhere between two and six weeks   team doctor Geoffrey Verrall said in a statement The final of the triangular contest  which also includes the host West Indies  will be played on June     which seems to rule Warner out for the rest of the series The injury comes as the left hander is in some of the best form of his career Warner was named man of the match on Saturday after completing his first ODI century outside Australia  a knock of     off     balls at the appropriately named Warner Park Just two weeks ago he captained Sunrisers Hyderabad to victory in the final of the Indian Premier League Warner is looking at the positives of his enforced absence after a busy stretch of cricket  Its obviously disappointing to be sidelined given the form Ive been in  but this  will give me the chance to freshen up and spend quality time with my family after an intense period of action  Australia lead the triangular series with two victories from three games  br   They next meet West Indies in St Kitts on Monday 
Stand in centre back Shkodran Mustafi headed his first goal for Germany and Bastian Schweinsteiger scored in stoppage time as the world champions survived several scares to beat Ukraine     in their opening Euro      Group C match on Sunday Mustafi  who started in the absence of regular centre back Mats Hummels  rifled home a header after    minutes to give Germany the lead  which was not extended until Schweinsteiger  a   th minute substitute  swept home from close range Germany  bidding for a fourth Euro triumph but first since       dominated possession  but also relied on three top saves from keeper Manuel Neuer and a goal line clearance by Jerome Boateng to come out on top Ukraine  playing in their second European championship  harried and hustled their opponents and their tight defence offered few clear sights of goal to the Germans Yet lone striker Roman Zozulya was unable to offer much threat  except at the very start and in the closing stages as Ukraine pushed on in search of an equaliser In a breakneck first half  Ukraine s Yevhen Konoplyanka forced Germany keeper Neuer to make a flying save in the fourth minute before the Germans steadily took control  with Toni Kroos orchestrating most of their attacks It was from his free kick  that Mustafi  who last featured for Germany in March and only made the side because Hummels was recovering from a muscle injury  leapt behind Serhiy Sydorchuk to power in a header Ten minutes later Sami Khedira had the chance to double Germany s lead as Kroos floated a ball beyond the defence  but he shot straight at the keeper By then though  the Ukrainians had woken up and  driving their full backs higher up the pitch  forced Neuer to punch over a strong header from Yevhen Khacheridi Boateng was then forced into a dramatic clearance  having first lost the ball before hacking it clear while back pedalling into the net  Lone striker Zozulya also had an effort disallowed for offside as Germany hung on until halftime Ukraine posed less of a threat in the second half  relying on hopeful long balls forward  while their keeper Andriy Pyatov was forced into action to save a long range effort from Khedira  a low drive from Thomas Mueller and from Mesut Ozil  when he was through on goal Germany suffered one final fright when Mustafi headed back over Neuer s head  leaving the goalkeeper to scramble back towards his own net  while appearing to body check substitute striker Yevhen Seleznyov in the process Then  in the final seconds  with Ukraine pushing up  Germany countered and Schweinsteiger slammed in an Ozil cross to score The result extended Germany s unbeaten run against Ukraine to six matches and maintained their record of never having lost their opening match in a European Championship Germany will play joint group leaders Poland at the Stade de France on Thursday  when Ukraine take on Northern Ireland in Lyon Several hours before the match  German and Ukrainian supporters scuffled briefly in the centre of Lille  though police quickly brought the situation under control 
Sri Lanka coach Graham Ford called for all no ball decisions to be taken by the third umpire as his side reacted to an incorrect call in the third Test against England with an extraordinary flag protest at Lords on Sunday At stumps  Sri Lanka were    without loss in their second innings  needing a further     runs on Mondays fifth and final day to reach an imposing victory target of     More realistically  their goal was to prevent England  already     up in the three match series  taking the    wickets they needed to complete a whitewash But England captain Alastair Cook     not out batting down the order after a knee injury suffered while fielding  may not have been able to declare his sides second innings on     for seven had a few close calls Sunday gone Sri Lankas way instead Significantly  Sri Lanka thought they had Alex Hales    who went on to make       out for    when he was bowled by Nuwan Pradeep  But Australian umpire Rod Tucker had already called a no ball  Replays suggested Pradeeps front foot may have been behind the crease but fielding teams are unable to challenge a no ball call by an umpire and Hales survived In February  a similar incident saw Australias Adam Voges make     in a Test against New Zealand in Wellington after being reprieved on seven following an incorrectly called no ball by English umpire Richard Illingworth Under International Cricket Council regulations  the third umpire is powerless to intervene in such situations There are proposals on the table to prevent a repeat of these types of incidents and Ford said   The ICC have to look at it  It seems strange with the technology available that you can still get a line call wrong   the South African added  The best solution is for the umpires to worry about whats happening down the other end and let technology look after the line call   The game has a funny way of kicking you when you are down  That was a kick we didnt need  The Sri Lanka management reacted to Haless reprieve by draping the national over the tourists dressing room balcony for some    minutes Ford said this wasnt so much a protest as a gesture of solidarity with the players out on the middle  At that stage we felt the boys were fighting hard and we wanted to show our support from the dressing room to boost their morale   only for us to find out thats not the done thing and we had to take it down   said Ford He added that Tucker had apologised to Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews for his mistake  He got the news from the third umpire and he apologised to Angelo  It was very good of him to have done that and we move on  Hales  for all his good fortune Sunday  was still left waiting for a maiden Test hundred The Nottinghamshire opener  out for    and    in the first two Tests  got closer still on Sunday before he was lbw to medium pacer Mathews Somewhat ironically  in view of Sri Lankas earlier protest  Hales sought a review of the decision only for DRS to find in the tourists favour on this occasion  Its disappointing again to come so close   said Hales  whose     ball innings included    fours and a six  But it was pretty decent delivery and I had my fair share of luck    bowled off a no ball  umpires calls and edges    I guess the luck ran out  
Substitute Raul Riudiaz s hotly disputed goal earned Peru a shock     win over Brazil in Foxborough  Massachusetts on Sunday  the defeat knocking the five times world champions out the Copa America at the group stage The Peruvian forward appeared to use his hand to score from close range with    minutes remaining and after a long delay while the referee consulted with his assistant while taking advice through an earpiece  he allowed the goal to stand Television pictures showed Ruidiaz grinning after the goal had been awarded but the Brazilian players were apoplectic with rage at a decision that sent them tumbling out of the tournament before the knockout stages for the first time since       We saw that the ball hit his hand but you can t complain   Brazil centre half Miranda told reporters    The referee  said he discussed it with four officials and that they didn t see the handball  Brazil tried from the first minute to score but the ball didn t want to go in unfortunately  and that s football  If you don t score you pay for it  The result lifted Peru to the top of Group B and eliminated Brazil  who dropped down to third place behind Ecuador in the tournament being played in the United States to celebrate the centenary of governing body CONMEBOL and the Copa America Following the conclusion of the first two groups in the    team competition  Peru will play Colombia in the quarter finals in New Jersey on Friday  while the host nation will take on Ecuador in Seattle a day earlier Mexico  Venezuela and Argentina have already qualified from the other two groups with a match to play with either Chile or Panama joining them in the quarter finals pending the result of their showdown on Tuesday MISSED OPPORTUNITYThe loss was a harsh one for Brazil  who knew a draw would have been enough to see them advance and were generally the better team without ever really threatening the Peruvian goal Peru upped the tempo after a lacklustre first half and the controversial decider came after    minutes when Andy Polo whipped in a low cross that fell just behind the onrushing Ruidiaz inside the six yard box The Universitario player appeared to handle the ball into the net to the immediate anger of the Brazilian players  who surrounded the Uruguayan referee along with several Peruvians before the official opted to give the goal after a long delay Elias then missed a golden opportunity to equalise for Brazil in injury time but he failed to connect properly with only the goalkeeper to beat The result came just hours after Ecuador hammered a hapless Haiti     to guarantee their quarter final berth Enner Valencia opened the scoring after    minutes and Jaime Ayovi doubled Ecuador s advantage nine minutes later after a swift counter attack Christian Noboa made it     with a well placed shot after    minutes before Antonio Valencia tapped home the fourth after another break on    minutes The result left Haiti  who were competing in the competition for the first time  bottom of the group on no points and a goal difference of minus

Ireland can take encouragement from a     draw in their Euro      Group E opener on Monday but the result was a cause of great concern for Sweden whose mediocrity contrasted starkly with their opponents  desire Ireland were the better team and Sweden were fortunate to grab an equaliser when Irish defender Ciaran Clark headed a cross into his own goal after Wes Hoolahan had opened the scoring with a splendid strike early in the second half It was another misfortune for Ireland at the Stade de France  where they were playing for the first time since Thierry Henry s infamous handball for France led to a goal that crushed the      World Cup qualifying dreams of the Irish in a playoff Monday s match was probably the one the Irish and Swedes had targeted for a win in a section that also features traditional European force Italy and a talented Belgium side Martin O Neill s Boys in Green  however  can be more optimistic than Erik Hamren s Blue Yellows  who did not manage a single shot on target despite the efforts of talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic  who was kept fairly quiet by Ireland s defence  We have two very  very tough matches coming against two sides that are very classy   said O Neill  But if I can take anything from the performance today  it was that the players looked accomplished  We have the desire but the players are growing into international football  Both teams were backed by hordes of fans and the yellow and green armies brought a festive touch to the Stade de France  in sharp contrast with the violence that has marred the tournament O Neill s side showed a real desire to win  making two attacking substitutions after Sweden s equaliser  while the Scandinavians looked slow and toothless until Ireland took a deserved lead three minutes after the break Hoolahan struck a superb half volley into the net from Seamus Coleman s perfect cross into the area triggering a roar rarely heard in the usually subdued Stade de France MATCH WINNING CHANCEThat acted as a wake up call for Sweden  who were relying on their enigmatic    year old captain Ibrahimovic  I came like a king  left like a legend   Ibrahimovic quipped as he left Paris St Germain at the end of last season after helping them win a second straight domestic treble He was certainly neither when he returned to Paris on Monday In the first half  Ibrahimovic looked lost on a pitch where which he won two French Cup and two League Cup trophies and  while he produced the cross that led to Ireland s own goal  the striker failed to convert a chance in the closing stages In the   st minute  Ibrahimovic made a rare break down the left flank into the area and his cross was headed into his own goal by the unfortunate Clark Twelve minutes later  however  Ibrahimovic just failed to connect as Martin Olsson s cross whizzed in front of him  missing the chance to score an almost certain winner albeit undeserved  The feeling right now is disappointment rather than coming back for a draw   said Hamren  For the first    minutes Ireland were better  Credit to Ireland  Our attack was really bad in the first half  They were able to close us down We didnt lose but Im disappointed because we didnt play the way we should have done  Ibrahimovic added   I tried but I can do much better
