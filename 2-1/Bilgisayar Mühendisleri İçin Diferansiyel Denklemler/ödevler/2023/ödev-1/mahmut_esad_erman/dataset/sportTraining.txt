Australia look set to field two specialist spinners at the Sydney Cricket Ground  SCG  for the first time in a decade when they host West Indies in a dead rubber New Years test starting this weekend An inexperienced and demoralised West Indies touring party succumbed by an innings and     runs in Hobart and     runs in Melbourne to hand their hosts an unassailable     lead in the three match series That position  and the likelihood of a turning wicket at the SCG  have encouraged Australia to test out the twin spin option of Nathan Lyon and Stephen OKeefe ahead of their tour of Sri Lanka later this year That the hosts can afford to put out an experimental side in one of the more venerable fixtures in the Australian sporting calendar is not to say there will be nothing at stake when the match gets underway on Sunday       GMT  For West Indies there is pride and a chance to show more of the fighting spirit that stalled Australias victory match in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne last weekend A     sweep  meanwhile  would send Australia above India to second in the test rankings and they would return to the summit if England can maintain a winning start and beat South Africa in their ongoing four match series Off spinner Lyon is one of the first names on the Australian team sheet these days and he looks like being joined by left arm finger spinner OKeefe in the Australian line up That was made all the more likely when seamer Peter Siddle failed to train on Friday because of an ankle injury  leaving his place in the team in jeopardy OKeefes inclusion for his second test    his first on home soil    would make it the first time Australia have played twin spinners at the SCG since Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill took on South Africa at the ground in      Josh Hazlewood is likely to back up for a sixth straight test alongside James Pattinson in the pace attack with all rounder Mitchell Marsh offering support with his quickening medium pace deliveries after taking      in Melbourne While Darren Bravo  Denesh Ramdin and skipper Jason Holder showed some resistance with the bat in Melbourne  the paucity of the West Indies bowling is starkly illustrated by the fact that they have taken just    wickets over the first two tests Given how little pressure their pace attack have managed to exert on Australia so far in the series  West Indies might consider their own twin spin attack by bringing in leg spinner Devendra Bishoo alongside left arm orthodox Jomel Warrican 
After picking up pretty much every individual honour on offer in a spectacular       Australia captain Steve Smith has a more collective goal in his sights this year    restoring his country to the top of the test rankings Smith finished his annus mirabilis as the worlds top ranked test batsman and won the ICC Cricketer and Test Cricketer of the Year awards as well as the Allan Border Medal as Australias best player The    year old scored a remarkable       runs across all three formats  rattling up       in tests alone at an average of       with six centuries He was Australias highest run scorer as they secured a fifth    over World Cup triumph and he led the test side to series victories over India  New Zealand and West Indies Even in the Ashes defeat to England  the one major blot on Australias copy book for the year  he scored his maiden double century to claim the Man of the Match award at Lords Even before he was captain  though  Smith was always clear that team success came first With Australia already     up in the three match series  this weeks third test against West Indies might be a dead rubber but victory would send them above India into second place in the test rankings behind South Africa  Its a huge motivation  thats what we want to be  number one in all formats and were working extremely hard to get there   Smith told reporters on the eve of the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground  SCG  on Saturday  It would be nice to win this week and wrap this series up      Its been a good summer for us so far  so wed like to finish on a high  Defeat for South Africa in their ongoing series against England would then send Australia back to the summit but even if the English fail to build on their winning start  Februarys two test tour of New Zealand offers Smiths side another chance Australia beat the Black Caps     on home soil in November but the series was closer than the scoreline would suggest and Smiths side  like many of the top test teams  have struggled to win series overseas in recent years  Playing away from home is a challenge for all teams around the world at the moment  I think thats one of the big things were going to be judged on   Smith added  Its going to be a big challenge in New Zealand  but Im confident if we can continue playing the way we are  hopefully we can have a lot of success over there  Smiths own form hit a minor blip when he was dismissed for    in Australias only innings in the first test against West Indies but the runs were flowing again in Melbourne last week after knocks of     and    without being dismissed  I felt pretty good last week  I guess it was good just to spend a little bit of time in the middle again   Smith said  All of my movement and my swing and everything was back in synch I went back and looked at some footage before the Melbourne test and felt my bat face was a little bit closed  Last week I got my bat face back where I wanted it to be and everything felt really good  so hopefully I can score a few more this week 
 New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum on Sunday said tainted bowler Mohammad Amir should be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to play for Pakistan in limited overs matches in New Zealand this month Amir has been named in the Pakistan squad which will play three Twenty   and as many one day games against New Zealand over the next three weeks but his participation depends on New Zealand immigration officials allowing him a visa The fast bowler was only    when he handed a five year ban from cricket in      for his involvement in spot fixing He also served three months of a six month prison term His ban  imposed by the International Cricket Council  ICC   has now ended and McCullum said today he should be allowed to resume his career He was a very young man at the time and he s gone through a sound rehabilitation program  McCullum said If he gets out on the field against us  then you play against the man you re playing against  not a man who may have made some mistakes as a youngster  added the explosive batsman New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White also supported Amir s inclusion in the Pakistan squad but stressed that was a personal view and not that of his organisation He was a very  very young man  a boy really  when he was suspended   White said He showed remorse at the time  admitted to it  He s gone through all the rehabilitation and education as prescribed by the ICC I m personally comfortable with him coming to New Zealand and playing  added White New Zealand s immigration department issued a statement before Christmas saying it had not yet received a visa application for Amir and would consider one when it is received A decision is likely next week

Big financial incentives for gamblers  small tournaments of little consequence to top players and the ease of fixing the outcome of a one on one sport have helped turn world tennis into a haven for match fixers  according to experts and industry insiders Tennis was rocked on Monday by allegations that the games authorities have failed to deal with widespread match fixing  just as the Australian Open  the first grand slam tournament of the year  kicked off in Melbourne Multiple sources told Reuters that the revelation was no surprise to those who closely follow the sport  where  out of the spotlight at small tournaments around the world  the temptations are obvious and malfeasance very difficult to prove Dozens of untelevised tournaments are held annually and top players often inexplicably lose to relatively unknown opponents  said Steve Georgakis  a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney  who is researching match fixing in tennis  If you have a look at the big tournaments  the Opens or Olympic Games  youll notice that in a lot of these tournaments the favourite usually wins   he said But at a small tournament the following week  how could anyone prove that a top    player didnt lose because they were exhausted or injured  said Georgakis A highly ranked player is almost certain to be the odds on favourite to win in these small tournaments and thus has the greatest opportunity to make money by intentionally losing to an outmatched player  handing a big payoff to those behind the fix  Its a one on one sport and what you do is  youre the favourite and you get a few other people to load up on the other player to win and then you throw the match And you can never get caught   Georgakis added Sports betting has exploded in recent years with the proliferation of online and mobile gambling sites  and could be worth as much as    trillion annually  Patrick Jay  an independent betting expert  told the United Nations in      In that sea of money  tennis is the second most active betting market  trailing only soccer  research conducted by the European Gaming and Betting Association shows Betting on tennis is relatively simple and comes with enormous potential payoffs  a professional tennis gambler told Reuters under the condition of anonymity Many bookmakers have created disincentives to bet point by point or game by game with limits on those types of bets  pushing gamblers towards the payoffs for a winning bet on the overall match  Say you want to throw a game but win the match  why would you bother  You can only win a couple of thousand of dollars   the gambler said Bookmakers are obliged to report suspicious betting patterns to the Tennis Integrity Unit  which was set up to police illegal activities in world tennis But a source at a major bookmaker told Reuters under the condition of anonymity that it is ultimately up to the authorities to act  Most money is won by betting on the favourite  which is not a good result for bookmakers   he added  But if hes up one set to love and then  in play  people start betting on the outsiderthat would be us getting on the front foot  most likely  to say  to the authorities  is there anything you need for us to look into    the bookmaker said
