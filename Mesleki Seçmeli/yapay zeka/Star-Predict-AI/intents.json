These shirts were inexpensive, so my expectations are possibly unreasonable in this price range. To be honest, they were a bit thinner than I expected. Not overly thin, but somewhere between medium and thin. I don't expect them to last as long as the other shirts I purchased. They are starting to lose their shape after a couple of months of use, while the others from about a year and a half ago are still generally going strong. I'm not a fan of the black text tagless design. Mostly because it is difficult to find black text on a dark-colored shirt. In theory, the front should be how I folded it, and a search unnecessary. However, before coffee, this is more of a challenge than one would expect. I think I would buy a higher thickness shirts instead.",

And when I take them off at the end of the day, they're not \"moist\" so the wicking must be doing its job.  The 2XL ones I have fit nicely as well, without another shirt overlapping them.  I have a set of straight black XL Gildan shirts that I use for under my work shirts that are a bit more \"crispy\" than this set, I don't know if I just need to break them in or wash them a bunch more times; but they have a feeling like the fibers are \"tight\" whereas this set (multiple colors) are softer and \"billowy-er\" where you feel like you could move around easier in them.  The dark blue XL I found just now does feel \"harder\" than the dark blue 2XL, but it's still softer than the black XLs I have - so it might just be a case of needing to work out the fibers and send it through a washer-dryer series a few extra times.",

Over all quality is very good and form factor is good after a wash. Most box store manor brand (one with the fruit) will shrink significantly and not hold form and look all wrinkled. Shrinkage is 5% after washing in cold and low dry. Might be an issue is you wash in hot or warm with normal dry cycle. Likely to shrink 10%.  Cons: Like many brands today sizing is an issue with smaller sizes; shirt designs in this category is totally inconsistent. Sizing for small tend to run more like fitted or even slim. With Gildan the waist is extremely tight and I felt like a sausage even before washing. Granted I have gained a little weight during Covid but not that much. I washed one just to see the shrinkage if I decide to purchase a size up. Just as a note many of my other brands in small still fit fine. Other review have commented on the sizing issues also.",

So, for convenience, I ordered these, since the reviews seemed to indicate they were pretty good and the material content is almost identical to what I usually buy. I am a female - but prefer to buy men's t-shirts for casual wear; I always found them to be more comfortable than t-shirts made for women. I also found that men's t's are usually made much more durable than those made for women - and last for years. However, when these came in I was disappointed to see how thin the material felt and how sheer they were. Sheerer than any men's t-shirt that I have ever seen. I also found the shape quite different - compared to most men's t-shirts that I own. I am guessing, however, the thinness may be great for someone wanting to keep cool - so I gave it two stars for that.",

This doesn’t appear to be an option anymore. There are so many new companies that come out making items like this, you never know who to trust so your knee-jerk reaction is to go with the name you recognize as quality. Unfortunately that quality no longer exists. I’ve had two out of the six T-shirts have the stitching fray and come out of the collar area. I’m 59 years old and don’t do heavy “construction“ work around my home so it’s always just light yardwork and these T-shirts can’t hold up to that. And when they come out of the dryer, the collar is all wonky because of the black band that’s sewn in there to give the collar structure, doesn’t expand or contract at the same rate the cotton around it does.",

They're not tapered as suggested in the description and pictures. It's a one-size-fits-all design. That can really be seen in the neck opening. For the Large size that I got, it's a whopping 11.5 inches in diameter. That means for normal men, it will sit low, causing a lot of neck and back to be exposed, and also, the neckline will be really loose. For comparison, my Jockey t-shirts are 8.5 to 10 inches, and a couple that I got at Target (Merona) are 9 inches. To make matters worse, after one wash, the material along the neckline curled badly. An oversized neck opening with a curled rim is NOT a good look. The shirts are simply unwearable in public. So all 6 immediately go into the rag drawer and I'll use them for painting or other messy jobs where it's okay if the shirt gets ruined. No idea why these shirts are getting good reviews.",

They are about 2-3 inches too long, but I have a large chest and broad shoulders with a smaller waist (6ft. tall, 48 inch chest, 34 inch waist) so finding a perfect fit for me is hard.
