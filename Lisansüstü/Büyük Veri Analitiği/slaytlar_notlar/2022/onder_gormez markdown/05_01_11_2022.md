# 5. Week - 1 November 2022 Tuesday

# Resource Manager
It basically manages the applications

# YARN Architecture

## Node Manager
* It publish heart beat messages periodically to Resource Manager
* 

## Resource Manager
* Receive the job and create application master.
* Application Master decide how much resource needed for this job (ex: 2 GB RAM needed)
* Resource Manager send to the resource information to app master.

# Hadoop Platforms
* Minimum Java 8 required.

You can use;
* Standalone: Puts master and slaves in one instance
* Pseudo Distributed: Emulate the distributed mode inside the same machine
* Distributed: Fully Distributed among other machines

## Installation
You need to create ssh key for accessing the hadoop console

## Start Hadoop
/bin/start-all.sh
jps
/bin/stop-all.sh

* Web-base UI
  * http://localhost:5000


TODO: Next week we have to have installed hadoop version inside our machine. Because of the new homework assignment.

# Motivation Questions

GFS: Google File System
HDFS: Hadoop Distributed File System

* Commodity hardware will be fail!
HDFS: Software is intelligent enough to handle hardware failure!

* Data loss on hardware fail?
HDFS: Replicate the data

* Distributed?
HDFS: Master-Slave Architecture!
