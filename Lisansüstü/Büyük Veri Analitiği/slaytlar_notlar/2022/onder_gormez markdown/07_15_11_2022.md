# 7. Week - 15 November 2022 Tuesday

## Importance of Local Aggregation
Associative array inside the map method is faster than the combiner. But this may be cause the memory (ram) overflow.


## Algorithm Design: Running Example
co-occurrence: Birlikte nerelerde geçtiklerini bulmaya yarıyor.
* IMPORTANT: The direction from begining to end, so one direction considered. The reverse direction is not considered! Otherwise it is very difficult.

Example: The machine learning is fun.

Tümünün 2'li kombinasyonları şeklinde
**Pairs - (n - 1)! / (2!)**
TODO: Formülü farklı örneklerle kontrol et. Şu şekilde de olabilir. **(n - 1)! / (n!)**
n: word count
(the, machine)
(the, learning)
(the, is)
(the, fun)
...

**Pairs - (n - 1)! / 2!**
Example: The machine learning

n = 3
(3)
6 different key pair generated

1 - the machine
2 - the learning
3 - machine the (not considered)
4 - machine learning
7 - learning machine (not considered)
6 - learning the (not considered)

## Caveats and Context
Caveat: a warning or proviso of specific stipulations, conditions, or limitations.

* Devops engineers design the infrastructure.
* Even if you never have to worry about it, it helps you understand the underlying process

## Big Data Applications

### On-Premise
* Your own data center
* Physically build cluster
* Maintain by your own
* Expensive, huge
* Security concerns, regulations prevent you, banking, insurance, defence, goverment, hospitals, military etc.

* Government sometimes allow the store data in national cloud

Small Data Center (3 - 20)
Mideum Data Center (20 - 100)
Large Data Center (1000s)
Global Data Center (10000s over multiple DCs)
Amazon Data Center ...
Google Data Center ...
Facebook Data Center ...

### On-Cloud

Different working way
#### IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service
* You have a virtual server
* You need to install OS, softwares, etc. by your own

#### PaaS: Platform as a Service
* Basic OS images included
* Platform you deploy codes inside

#### SaaS: Software as a Service
* Software Clusters
* You just use it, You don't do anything
* One Drive, Gmail, Dropbox, etc.

## What Machines to Buy

Example: Dell data center server rack mounted. (Maybe one 10K $)

Name Nodes: Requires large RAM (12 core CPU, 128 GB RAM, Gb Ethernet, 16 TB 7200 Hard Disk)

Data Nodes: (96 GB RAM, 24 TB Hard Disk)

## Specifying Network Topology
topology.script.file.name
Hadoop Configuration
Master Name Node(192.011.07.100)
Secondary Name Node (192.011.07.101)
Data Node 1 (192.011.07.01)
Data Node 2 (192.011.07.02)
Data Node 3 (192.011.07.03)
Data Node 4 (192.011.07.04)

### Using Secondary Namenode
dfs.http.address so it knows where to get edit
Hadoop ta master name node çöktüğünde cluster tamamen çöker. Bunu engellemek için Secondary name node ayakta olmalı ve tekrar hadoop restart edilmeli.

## Getting Ready to Run
start-dfs.sh
Starts namenode and datanodes
start-YARN.sh
Starts resource manager

## fsck and Rebalance
Some rare conditions, you need to rebalance the data inside the dfs.
bin/start-balancer.sh
Restart HDFS

## Removing Nodes
Could just unplug... 
dfs.hosts.exclude and add mapred.hosts.exclude

bin/hadoop dfsadmin -refreshNodes

# No SQL Databases
We moved to the new topic.

Hadoop works on immutable data. Write ones, read many times.

We need time to time write data multiple times and read many times.
And also not fit the one machine. We need to split more parts

## Three Core Ideas

* Partitioning (Sharding)
for scalabilitiy
for latency
* replication
for robustness
for thhroughput
* caching
for latency

## What do RDBMs Provide?
RDBMs: Relational Database Management Systems
ACID: Atomic Consistency Isolation Durable
* Relational model with schemes
* Powerful, flexible query language
* Transactional semantics: ACID
* Rich ecosystem, lots of tool support.
* Consistency
* ATOMic transactions
* A lot of tools (My SQL, MS SQL, Postgre SQL, ...)

Not distributed.

## How do RDBMs do it?

Multiple Server RDBMs --> have 2 phase-commit (Need special computers, expensive, appliance server like 100K $)
Coordinator says, We need to commit data
DB in Server 1: I get the data ACK
DB in Server 2: I get the data ACK
DB in Server 3: I get the data ACK

Hepsi datayı almaz ve commit leyip ACK dönmezse Commit Abort edilir.
Prepare tüm server lar tarafından alınmazsa rollback edilir.


If the coordinator down, all data connection lost
Must design up front, painful to evolve. Sometimes you need flexible schema. Schema don't determined fixed. For example for web sites


## No SQL (Not only SQL (Relational))

## (Major) Types of NoSQL Databases
* Key-value stores
* Column-oriented databases
* Document stores --> Mongo DB
* Graph databases --> Neo4J

## Key-Value Stores: Data Model
* Stores associations between keys and values
* Key are usually int, string, etc primitive types

## Key-Value Stores: Operations
**Very simple APIs**
Get - fetch value associated with key
Put - set value associated with key

**Optional Operations**
Multi-get
Multi-put
Range queries

**Consistency**
Atomic puts (usually)
Cross-key operations: who knows?

## Key-Value Stores: Implementation
* Non-persistent
Just a big in-memory hash table
* Persistent
Wrapper around a traditional RDBMS



Key         Value
1057        ...
1058        string
1059        double
1060        ...
1061        

The ring topology used system server wide
h = 2^n - 1 and h = 0
Each machine holds pointers to predecessor and successor
Which machine holds the key? Datanın olduğu node (bilgisayara) gitmek için O(n) lik bir arama yapılması gerekiyor.

+ "finger table" like (+2, +4, +8, ...)
We reduce the algorithm O(n) to O(logn) in this case
