**Edit test.c
**to compile and to see some files for compilation phases of program
-----------------------------------------------
gcc test.c -save-temps -o my_test
> gcc : our c compiler program
> test.c : source code to compile and than to execute
> -save-temps : flag used to save temporary files of compilation
> -o mytest: flag is used to rename the executable file
-->Note: We have to add gcc into environmental variables before compilation
------------------------------------------------
Phases:

** Preprocessing(test.c -> test.i): subsitution is performed for macros, includes, etc.; and comments are removed.
** Compilation (test.i -> test.s) : conversion from source code into assembly code, is performed. In this file, we can see assembly equivalents of some source codes 
such as + -> ADD, = -> MOV. We, however, might still observe some C codes like printf, as they are already compiled codes to link into executable program. 
** Translation (test.s -> test.o) : translation from assembly code into machine code. Here, compiled codes like printf are not included yet. 
** Linking: ([test.o +..+ *.o files]->my_test.exe) : Combining .o files into executable file, my_test.c. The size is dramatically increased because other compiled codes are linked.
